 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nThis experience is not my first with cyclobenzaprine but I wanted to report on it because my first experience involved mixing a smaller dose of the drug with a high dose of hydrocodone, alprazolam, and diazapam, and resulted in me having a strange visual trip while sitting in one of my english classes.\r\nThe experience I am reporting was only with cyclobenzaprine and was much different than the experience I had the first time.\r\nMe and my friend M had received a large quantity of Cyclobenzaprine from a friend who was taking them for sleep but decided that prescription drugs were bad and she wanted to find a more natural way to help her sleep, so she gave me and M an almost full bottle of 10 mg Cyclobenzaprine's. Since I had an interesting experience before(not thinking about the mixing effects of the other drugs)I figured a larger dose could only be better.\r\nMy school was having a large tennis match with a rival school that evening so me and M each took 5 of the 10mg pills and went to watch the match. About 30 mins after taking the pills I really felt nothing, slightly drowsey but thats about it.  1 hour into it I was still feeling a bit drowsy and also slighty dissapointed that the pills really didnt do much.\r\nI waited another half hour or so and still nothing much and we were loosing the tennis match so I decided to go home and take a nap for awile because I was a bit tired and there was nothing to do, so I went home. Now usually when I got home to take a nap or something I will go up to my room because I am a light sleeper and do not want to be disturbed by my family, but when I laid down on my couch and felt tired enough to sleep rite there without problem so I dozed off for awile, so I thought.\r\nHeres where things get wierd, when I layed down it was around 8:30 and when I woke up I figured I had just slept for about an hour or so cuz it was dark outside and 9:30 was when I got dark at that time in the year. But when I looked up at the clock it was 1:30 AM and I was amazed at how long I slept, so I got up and felt really strange, my body felt really heavy and my thoughts were very cluttered and missmanaged, I tried to get up to walk to my room but that was hard. \r\nEventually I got to my feet and started walking towards the stairs, I was very disoriented and had a hard time walking, I had to use the walls as a support to get me to the stairs. After a long difficult journey up the stairs I laid down in my bed and imediatley passed out.\r\nNow I do not know the reason for this late reaction to the Cyclobenzaprine's, maby if I just would have stayed out a bit longer I could have enjoyed the experiance A but more. Next time I am going to try 30 mgs. with a few beers.\n\n\n"
