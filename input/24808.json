 "report": "<p>Well, I will make my history a long story short. Suprisingly enough, I didn't start off on cigarettes or marijuana... or alcohol. It was Adderall. I .. took it as prescribed at the age of 13. Every morning, First Class, instead of being sleeply, disinterested, I gave my teacher my undivided attention. I received a 97 A in that class, too.</p><p>Knowledge is dangerous. Being a early bird, for once I wanted to stay up all night with my friends. I'd always be the 'wussy who went to bed early to get up at 8 am.' I wanted to show them up so bad. They didnt know what Adderall was but I said 'These three pills will beat you all.' So I took the 3 pills, each 20mg, and went to bed, with everyone laughing in my face. I thought it was unreal. Until 1 hour later. I woke up (VERY UP) to my suprise with them all sleeping. I was up all night, as I wanted! I woke them up and said 'wanna sneak out? wanna stay up? wanna play music?' I got the 'why not?' from them, and as we all know people who are swimming in sleep just go straight back to sleep. But me, I was up until 9 am. From that night on, my life would never be the same.</p><p>It's been three years since that night. My parents eventually noticed and took it away just a year ago. All that year, I thought... what now? What's going to help me be that A+ Student? How will I have fun every night, happy? Well, I found ways. My best friend is prescribed, so usually when he comes to crash at my place, he gives me some. But now... I am a C Student in my sophomore year. I blew it, I made a huge mistake. I told my parents just that... and I was able to score a meager fix of Concerta (methylphenidate) and I take it for school, and it helps. But not as much as adderall. Time-Released makes me depressed after a mere 20 minute high.</p><p>All I can say is that... Whenever someone goes out of their way to give me Adderall in the morning, I take it. Lasts all day. It makes me so much happier (Abuse of amphetamines from before gave me an Amphetamine-Induced Clincal Depression) and usually when I have a conflict I use horrible coping mechanisms, such as cutting, and drinking, yelling... But when I'm on Adderall I just fly over it. Quote my journal entry from a day while being high 'I have a 'problem' today. I failed my exams. But I'm just too busy to think about it, I just fly over the problem. And it never visits me again.'</p><p>Boy, with that great thinking, all my problems came back and bit me in the ass. It's funny. When I'm not an adderall, or I'm coming down, I think... 'I'm quitting this shit. I hate this feeling!' However when someone offers it to me, I take it. I know I'll always be addicted to amphetamines. No other drug can compete, I'd ditch em all for a night on Adderall.</p><p>No doubt it helps a school career. I'm sure people don't want to go down my path, and I sure don't want them to either.</p>"
