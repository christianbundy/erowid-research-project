 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nA buddy of mine came across some 5meo-amt capsules and I bought two. Me and another friend (his name will be C) decided to hang on to them and try and find some more for our other friends, but we couldn't, so we took them around 7:00pm one evening in the Fall. We were at our friend's house, and his sister was going to keep an eye on us for the night. \r\nAbout half an hour after taking it, I started to feel very strange sensations, I could feel the wind blow through my clothes, even though I was indoors. Eventually, this feeling turned into pins and needles all over my body, up and down my limbs and out my finger tips. I told a friend of mine who wasn't tripping that I 'felt like a cactus.'\r\nAfter about an hour or an hour and a half of me and C feeling these pins and needles, our other two friends who weren't tripping left to go to a party. We decided to go outside. I didn't feel like I was tripping yet, just a bit sick and dizzy. \r\nThe second we got outside, C puked his brains out. I thought I was going to throw up too, but I knew if I did I was going to shit my pants also because my stomach was very messed up, and I didn't want that to happen. I went to my car and got a jacket for C, because he was in a t-shirt, but he said he wasn't cold. It was probably about 30 degrees outside, and I realized I wasn't cold either. So we decided to sit on the porch and 'get our shit together.'\r\nWe started looking at the trees and they started moving like we were on acid. We looked at the clouds and they were moving very, very fast. Things were getting crazier by the second. We had been outside maybe about 10 minutes, but it felt like longer, so we went back inside.\r\nSo it had been about two hours of feeling like shit before the trip began, and when it kicked in, I peaked in about 20 minutes. I lost concept of time, and to be honest, it was a lot like acid, but the visuals were much more intense and I didn't feel crazy at all. I couldn't get worked up about anything. All I could say was 'Yeah, that's weird.' And the worst thing of all was that I didn't want to smoke cigarettes. And I LOVE cigarettes.\r\nEventually, the hallucinations got a but too much. Tracers were everywhere. Extremely 'thick' and 'real' not like mind tricks. When someone would take a drag off a cigarette, the whole room would light up. And smoke fell off cigarettes like a waterfall, instead of going up. My friend's cat had six eyeballs.  My pack of smokes was about the size of a cereal box.\r\nEverything was moving and breathing like on acid, but much faster. Eventually, I started shaking, but only on my right side. C said that the left side of his body was cold and the right was warm. Our friend's sister, who was sober and keeping an eye on us, confirmed this. It had been about 3 or 4 hours and things were pretty fucking ridiculous.\r\nOne of our friends came back from the party and asked if we wanted to ride in his car. When we got in his car, I looked at the clock and there weren't any numbers, just strange symbols...like hieroglyphics. When we were driving, everything looked normal. I said it was 'because we're catching up.' Whatever that means.\r\nWe stopped driving and I looked at a tree and it began to change seasons. Spring, fall, summer, and back again. This made my nuts hurt for some reason. We went back to our friend's house and I sat around with my right-side shaking and C began to complain of a headache that felt like '1000 knives being twisted in my brain.' It was about 3 or 4 in the morning now. He said he felt tired and was ready to go home. I said, 'Fuck no! I'm still messed up as all hell!' or something but we decided to walk to our cars anyways. When we got outside we looked over the treetops and saw the clouds moving really fast. But they weren't clouds, it was smoke. \r\nSo we all get in our friend's car and drive downtown to where a fucking building is burning down. There are cops and people and lights flashing everywhere and I'm still on the crazy fucking drug. There is a raging goddamn inferno not 20 yards from us and I can't believe  it and there's smoke everywhere and then suddenly there's a train roaring by behind us. Then, this guy walks up to us and says, 'Yeah, that's my appartment building burning down. That's my home.' Damn, seriously, this was fucking ridiculous.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] Anyway, we left and went back to our cars and I was convinced if I drove fast enough, I'd be able to make it home alright. But it was cold and my windshield was frozen. So I can't see and I'm hallucinating like crazy still and laughing like a lunatic, but I make it home somehow. I try an watch TV and I can't because everything moves waaaayyy too fast on the television so I decide to take a shower. I'm really just trying to kill time because time is on my side, and if I can just wait this one out I'll be alright. \r\nAll the drops of water in the shower leave tracers, and that's just too much to look at, so I get in my bed. It's about 5 or 6 in the morning now and I just lay there shaking until about 9am and started feeling a little better. I tripped lightly for another 2 hours. So it was about 14-16 hour trip. I didn't go to sleep until 5pm.\r\nThat drug is crazy.\n\n\n"
