 "report": "<p>This was my first time ever doing MDMA, I took a baloon of Nitrous before I took the pill, to get me in the mood for tripping.  I loved the Nitrous, it made buzzing go through my body, and I smiled brightly.  I took the pill right after that, I hadn't eaten for about 8 hours, so my stomach was empty.  I chewed the pill with my front teeth, cause I was told that it would hit me faster that way, then I chased the nasty taste with cold water.  It took only about 15 minutes before I started feeling different from every day reality.  I was sitting by my cousin on a couch, then he gave me a back massage, and it send chills through my whole body, then I gave him a back massage.</p><p>Then I stood up and made myself feel fear, I usually do this on shrooms to test my ability to pull myself out of a bad trip.  It was like a bad trip was almost impossible, the feeling of anxiety was numbed out, all I felt was tingling on my body instead.  I than became very happy, I was in heaven, now I see why they call it Ecstasy.  I hardly knew any of the people at this party, but they were rolling too, and it was like we already knew each other.  I talked with people I didn't know, as if they were great friends of mine, we talked about negativity and why does it exist?  What is the purpose of negativity?  Why dont we just never feel negative again?</p><p>Everyone kept mentioning my pupils to me, so I went into the bathroom to check them out.  I looked in the mirror and they were absolutely huge, I had no eye color, it was just one big huge pupil the took up almost my whole eye, it looked so awesome.</p><p>Then my cousin gave me two Nitrous wippets, and someone else gave me another one.  I agreed to take a tripple nitrous hit, I borrowed this big can from someone, I put all three whippets into the big can thing one by one.  Then I put the balloon on it and pulled the lever.  This balloon was absolutely huge, I sat back on the couch as everyone gathered around me to give me an E rush, I looked at everyone and realized that I loved them all.  Then I said, 'Goodbye everyone' with a smile, and started breathing in and out of the balloon.  Next thing I know I'm floating above my body with the greatest feeling of joy, and I looked down, and I could see everyone around me, giving me an E rush, and everything was grey, my surroundings were grey, and all the people giving me an E rush looked grey.  Then their seemed to be a moment of nothingness, then I came back to my body, with everyone still giving me an E rush.  I was like, 'Holy Shit!, I was floating out of my body!, everything was grey'.  Then someone said, 'I know!, it's always grey for me too!'.  This experience was absolutely amazing, and I will never forget it.</p><p>Smile : )</p>"
