 "report": "</p>\nWe were four explorers. Each one of us had a different responsibility. One held the beat, the other thudded along, the other soothed the soul, and then there was me. We were in a band, at this time. The four of us played little gigs here and there. We just enjoyed the music and didn't fantasize about making it big. We lived in a nice, hip little community and people were all very nice and happy there.</p><p>We usually didn't play while we were tripping. The lights, the crowd, the energy, it could lead to a pretty bad trip or a pretty bad show. But that October night we decided to drop 4 tabs each. Now, these tabs were quite strong. 2 hits was quite sufficient for a fun little foray into uncharted territory. So, 4 hits was a pretty heavy dose.</p><p>About 30 minutes after we dropped those polka dotted doses, the show began. We started with some blues covers while we waited. Into the second song we could feel it working its magic.</p><p>Now let me just explain, the people who come to see our shows are usually partaking in the psychedelic fun. Whether they were smokin pot, or trippin balls, these weren't square crowds we were playing for. So when we started acting strange and when we started saying some really bizarre shit in between songs, they were pretty large as to what we were on. After a couple more songs we were flying. This part gets kinda fuzzy, as it's been awhile, but I will relate as much as I can.</p><p>The stage went off into orbit. The music was the force that propelled it through the cosmos. We landed on Pluto to regale the ice people with the strangest music ever and then we went to other planets I've never seen before. All the while the music had the momentum of a comet. When I would look at the amplifiers they would ooze and green jelly poured from them. My guitar seemed like it was an extension of my being. The music took on angelic and demonic aspects at the exact same time. Sometimes we would be floating past the beautiful planet of Venus and other times we'd be standing on the sun itself! Letting the flames torment every fiber of our being.</p><p>Then there was nothing. No stars, no earth, the guitar and drums were gone. My body had crumbled into asteroids and smashed into the moon. There was nothing. And from this nothing came the most beautiful sound I could have ever imagined. It sounded as though god was speaking. And all this nothingness quaked and evaporated, and there was life! The music WAS life. Everything that is and was was right there! In the air. All my fear and love and hate and joy, it was all right there in the air. We were all cosmically linked into the same vibe and we were all playing as one. No...the music was playing us. Ecstasy and joy on every level. Life was everywhere and in everything!</p><p>That night was truly amazing. To be able to control your own trip so much like that and to know that you're controlling others' is truly a mind blowing experience. I felt so alive and whole that night. It was without a doubt the most magical night of my life.</p>"
