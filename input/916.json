 "report": "<p>\nAbout 6:30 In the morning i ate 38 seeds of the heavenly blue morning glory seeds.  About 25 minutes later i was feeling weird.  I thought that i was going to start to trip, but the complete opposite happened.  I was in 1st period and i started having extreme stomach pains.  I couldnt walk because my stomach hurt so bad.  I went and got some food thinking that maybe that if i had something on my stomach that i would feel better...It made it worse.  </p><p>I laid down on the floor in class and tried to sleep with the pain.  5 Minutes later i went to the bathroom and threw the fuck up everywhere.  Right after i threw up i tried to walk out of the bathroom but was stopped because my legs crampped up.  Both of my legs were locked tight for about 4 hours.  I had to go around most of the day with leg cramps and stomach pains.  I wouldnt recommend that anyone do that stupid plant.  There is no legal drug that is worth all of that pain.</p>"
