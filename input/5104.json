 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt was Christmas break and there was a blizzard in my area.  Many major roads were closed and if you wanted to go somewhere you had to walk in really deep snow.  I had ran out of weed, but I couldn't get any more because of the blizzard.  I became bored and looked around my house for any interesting OTC/Prescription drugs.  I was about to take some DXM when I noticed a hidden pill bottle in the medicine cabinet.  It was -----phetamine (I forget the exact name, but the market name was Didrex).  They were some old weight-loss pills my mom had.  \r\nI searched up info on the drug on the internet, but much help because it's not a common drug, but I did learn that 4mg of Didrex was equal to about 1mg of 'street' speed.  I took 5 pills, my memory is a little shady but I'm 90% shure they were 50mg pills, around 2:00pm.  I took the pills at the beginning of watching a movie.  I didn't notice any immediate effects, I guess 'cause I was sitting on my ass.  But when the movie was over and I went to look in the mirror, my pupils were huge.  I didn't feel overly energized, but I wasn't tired.  I felt very talkative too, bringing up old memories and stuff.   \r\nAt about 7:30pm I realized why speed is sometimes used for ADD.  I had a paper clip that I was playing with and I wanted to try to form it into a cube (the same cube that Silicon Graphics uses).  I worked on the cube for 2 hours, making it perfect.  A slight bend in a straight line was unacceptable, it needed to be perfect.  I stayed awake all night.  I could have gone to sleep if I forced myself, but there wasn't an urge for sleep.  To be honest, I spent most of the night jerking off to porn on my computer.  At about 2:00am I felt very paranoid, possibly a psychosomatic response.  At about 4:00 I saw visual change very similar to those in another experiance listed here.  Shadows seemed to change direction.  Day 2 was very much the same.  I took 7 pills this time.  I didn't feel much of a differance from the 5.  I once again spent the night looking at porn.  But, I did take a 15 minute nap.  I was sitting in my unlit room and drifted off.  But I came right back with energy.  The 3rd day was identical to the 1st day as far as experiances and effects.  \r\nOn the 4th day, I didn't take any pills.  I went to bed at around 9:00pm.  It was the deepest sleep I've ever had.  I never got into my comforter, and I never got undressed.  I just fell asleep on top of the bed.  But the amazing thing was that I didn't move an inch from the time I woke up.  I normally kick and roll around in my sleep.  My bed is normally a mess when I get up in the morning.  But I had a coma like sleep.  I fell asleep with the remote in my hand, it was still in my hand when I woke up. I had not moved at all,  you couldn't even tell that somebody had slept in my bed.\n\n\n"
