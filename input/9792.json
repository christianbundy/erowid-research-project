 "report": "<p>\nIve ingested 4 times this week,at 3-5 grams/session, and have gone 2 days with NO other drugs. i was intrested in the idea of smoking mushrooms but with rumors abound i figured i would read about it first. after an hour it sounded ok to me so, i ground some small dried caps at about 1-2 grams, stuffed it in the bowl of my bong and off i went at 2:50pm and smoked it all within 2 minutes.  the onset was mild and nothing like ingestion but by 3:10 pm i decided to write this summary of the experience. </p><p>Motivational?...Im not sure, but it's nice and not too overwhelming. Overall i would say there is something there but don't look forward to the same effects as ingestion!</p>"
