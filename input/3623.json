 "report": "<p>\nI've had some experience with both these drugs before, more so with the coke than the x.  Never combined them before though.  The setting was an all-day outdoor concert.  Just right for the tab (a medium-pure, slightly speedy variety called Rolex) but not for the combo!</p><p>On the trip down to the show, we got into the coke.  This was about an 8 ball of very good cocaine shared between 3 people.  Ate the tabs just before we arrived at the show, still high from the lines we'd snorted.  (20 min. at the most) As the roll started to kick in the feeling was fantastic; the initial rush of the x was intensified by the euphoria of the coke.  </p><p>However, after about an hour, the coke was obviously starting to lose effect.  The roll, meanwhile, was not where it should be.  Usually for a person of my weight, a 'Rolex' should kick in strong by an hour at least.  However, the slight down I was experiencing from the comedown of the coke made me feel as though I was just on the verge of rolling, the entire time.  </p><p>I wanted more coke... Bumped a bit more and this is when the x got as good as it was going to get.  Thereafter, the depression that typically follows a coke high was very unpleasant.  The slight roll made us hyper-aware of our  emotions; we were constantly talking about how we felt, comparing notes and whatever, and agreed that we were just feeling way too down.  Instead of opening up and getting happy with the ecstasy, we got more and more introspective.  Crash in every sense of the word.  Plus the feeling in the back of my head was progressing from a numbness to a hollow ache that was to last for hours.  Lots of tense muscles, very hard to relax.  </p><p>The emotional situation, I must add, heightened the unpleasant effects, because we were in a very intense situation as it was. (3 people, 2 having just broken up w/each other and the 3rd a new interest of one of us) We were just not suited for an outdoor public event; we couldn't dance, couldn't talk, couldn't do much but stare and wish we felt more one way or the other.  </p><p>I digress:</p><p>What I'm trying to say is that the effects of the two substances did not work well together.  Maybe this is obvious to everyone else, but we figured we'd have to try it to find out and we certainly did.  We wasted both substances and put ourselves in a strange wasted state of mind.</p>"
