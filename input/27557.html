One cold, stormy afternoon, during an abnormally auto-destructive period in my life, I thought I would try a little salvia to ease my nerves. A sexy ´shaman´ gave me an elegant pipe-full to try out for free, and seeing as though it is rather expensive to buy, I jumped at the offer.<br><br>
I inhaled quite alot, and instantly felt the effect. The effect is immediate, intense, but wears of rapidly. All in all my experience lasted around 6 minutes. The first thing that I became aware of was my seperation to my own body, I was in it, or hovering slightly over it, yet disconnected to the meat, and quite paralyzed. But part of me was still there, and this is the point that I need to stress, the many parts of myself I simultanously became conscious of whilst ´tripping´ on this ´shamans drug'. I no longer felt intergrated, whole. I was existing on many different levels of consciousness, or if you like, I was in a variety of dimensions, all at the exact same time, so understandably I felt a tad skitzo and ´broken up´ into pieces. Each part of the giant me was insanely different to the others.<br><br>
All the time that I was skimming through the levels, I was accutely aware of the sexy shaman´s eyes upon me. I felt embarrased about my incapacity to move or speak sense, so I closed my eyes and shut my mouth. I could feel the shaman´s energy enveloping me. I will tell you now that he was not a ´real´ shaman, but my mind prefers to remember him this way. I become incredibly self-conscious on this drug and it seemed to rip through time and space and interconnect, yet at the same time divide everything. I was paranoid that this guy from South-America could know my thoughts and sense my fear. All energies seemed interlaced, yet it was no spiritual-hippy feeling, it was quite scary.<br><br>
Maybe I feared death, or better said, the dissolution of my ego. When faced with death the ego panics and fear is the inevitable result. I feel that Salvia brings me closer to death, not physical death, but dissolution of my own identity.<br><br>
So I was on many planes at once, and I was ´shuffling´ through them all like a magician playing with a deck of cards. The shuffling, or flicking through realities happened at an inconceivable speed, so that concentration on a single plane proved difficult for too long, yet the second I was there seemed like an hour. Such is the true nature of time and space.<br><br>
The ´lowest´ part of ´me´ was in the Abyss, a void devoid of light and matter, a black hole of aloneness. Coming up from here I found myself in ´real reality´, solidness, fear and desire. The next level was an astral sketch of the physical room I was sitting in, and was a curious dance of colour, sound and light. Shuffling up a little higher, I was amazed to find myself in a world of fantasy, or was it. I seemed to be in another realm or even galaxy, but I definitely was in outer space, though close to some planet because I was flying through enormous, yet skinny, violet rocks which had nothing between them but empty space. There were many other flying machines or creatures, I do not recall exactly what they were, zooming about. On the highest level, everything was pure light and love. I know that sounds cheesy, personally I dig shadowland, but that is how it was. It was immaterial and sublime, without beings or distraction, everything was pure, vibrant energy. So I was flicking through all of these dimensions yet in all of them at the same time.<br><br>
Eventually my body functioned again and off went the sexy shaman and I, to have a drink.<!-- End Body -->
