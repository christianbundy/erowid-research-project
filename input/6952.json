 "report": "<p>\nI'm not exactly what people call a 'druggie' (actually, they call me that, but that's because I wear tie-dye ;) ), but I've had 2 completely different experiances with nutmeg, both pretty good.....</p><p>First time I tried nutmeg (as a 'I want to see if this crap really works' experiment), I used maybe 1 tbs. This was at maybe 11 pm. After about an hour, I got a little lightheaded, and went outside and lay down on the grass.  I felt calm and sort of.. I want to say, 'at one with nature'.  Yeah... then I went to bed... had some odd dreams, and then woke up at 5:30 am and listened to Simon & Garfunkel for a while.  I felt.. drawn into the songs somehow... when I closed my eyes, I could almost see the words and stuff in the songs..... I was pretty mellow the whole day... I mean, I'm usually pretty calm.. but... I felt like I couldn't be angry or upset, like it would've been impossible.</p><p>The second time I tried nutmeg was with some friends... took about 3 tbs this time, at about 4 pm.  After an hour or 2, I started to see little colored spots and lines (you know when you close your eyes really tight and you see spots? like that...).  This lasted maybe an hour... then I went for a walk in the woods. I tried to read, but the page was covered in blue and pink squiggles, so I just sat and looked up at the trees. This was cool, b/c the trees were all in weird focus (like, instead of seeing a bunch of brances in front of the sky, it looked like some little bits of sky in front of some branches).  I felt all calm and 'at one' again, though I stopped seeing things...</p><p>Between 9-10 pm, I started seeing things again... but this time... woah.. I mean, I wasn't seeing my lamp turn into a fairy or any of that sort of shit that I hear from people who've tried acid... but I started seeing more complicated things then before.  My personal favorite was a big, orange, spinning flower that changed size (I went around telling people about this ;) )....  I felt all heavy and slow, like what I imagine trying to move in quicksand or glue would be like... almost like I couldn't move.  after about 11 pm I went back to feeling almost normal....</p><p>The hallucinations were pretty vague (none seemed really solid)... but.. it was really neat.... And I didn't get any of the side effects people on here talk about, 'cept that I was really fucking tired the next 2 days...</p><p>Nutmeg's something I'd recommend trying at least once, (the shitty taste doesn't exactly make you want to use it a lot, but it's worth it..)....</p>"
