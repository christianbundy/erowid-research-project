I have done salvia a handful of times, varying from straight leaves to 10x standardized. A friend of mine told me that we were smoking 10x before and I smoked a heaping bowl before I felt anything. Recently I ordered my own off of the internet. I made sure to buy 10X standardized. The first time I smoked it was in my dorm room. I got out my bubbler, gave my friends their babysitting instructions, and took as fat a rip as I could. <br><br>
Before I could even breathe out, I was in a different world. All of my cultural and scientific constraints nonexistant. My mind free to roam. This took me by great surprise as my previous experience was hit after hit and a slow build up to the trip that comes. This first experience with 10x standardized was trippy but took me so off guard that I felt out of control. <br><br>
Now--- to tell you about the most intense trip I have ever experienced and the most spiritually significant. I was at a friends house with about 6 people in a big living room. I had drank a bottle of wine and had a comfortable buzz. I decided that I wanted to smoke some salvia that a friend had brought. I got out my friends bong, packed a little marijuana nug in the bottom as a stopper and loaded most of the bowl full. I began hitting and went exponentially faster. By about half way I could feel my mind losing it already- but determined to really experience salvia, I kept going faster until the whole bowl was sucked through. I dont remember handing the bong to my friend, but aparantly, my eyes glazed and I layed on the floor. The first thing I felt was the floor entwining and wrapping my legs first and then the rest of my body. I was being spun into a sort of cylinder of material. I suddenly felt as though I was on an assembly line being prepared for shipping. This thought was so real in my mind that I tore myself from the binding force and scooted back until my back was against the wall. I still felt as though my legs were stuck but was unconcerned. <br><br>
The twisting, tightening force was slowly turning into downward pulling. I was slowly being pulled feet first into the floor. After what felt like a few seconds I was waist deep in the floor and then I was resting my fore arms on the floor. Through all this I had a surprisingly calm demeanor. Looking into the hole that was pulling me down, I realized that there was a sort of being that was frantically pulling at my legs. The hole was a tornado-like swirling force, pulling evenly about my legs. I felt intrigued by what may lie further down the hole and tryed letting go of the edge. I would fall for a few seconds before being snapped back to the surface. I relate this to losing the connection between body and soul - and feeling grounded enough in life that it was impossible to let go fully. I felt secured by my arms and never felt scared by the small figure. He (the being was not human, but humanoid- about 3 feet tall and slender. He had dark brown to black skin which seemed to be in a constant motion- like static on a TV screen but all dark. There were flourescent blusish lines/veins covering his whole body), crawled up my legs, up my torso and came to sit on the edge of the hole until he could pull himself out. I felt sorry for his frantic and futile attempt to pull me into the hole but was, like I said before not uncomfortable by his presence. <br><br>
I looked him in the eye and somehow felt as though he was a part of me- That it was a repressed side of my ego. Suddenly, I was in the consciousness of the being, I began walking around the room with my eye level at about 3 feet. Keep in mind, I have not moved since scrambling to get my back against the wall and am now sitting, eyes closed, and breathing heavily. I walk to my friend, in the body of the dark being. She is sitting with her back to me - I feel the urge to grab her shoulders and do. I massage her shoulders for a few seconds and then I am snapped back into my wall propped normal consciousness. I lay down, exausted and paralyzed. I can hear everything going on in the room and hear my friends talking about me, but cannot respond. I lay for what feels like about five minutes before I can move again. <br><br>
In total, the whole experience felt like aproximately ten minutes. It turns out that the twisting/binding section took about ten seconds, the propping for about 15 minutes and the laying for about 20 minutes. Before telling my friends anything that had happened, I asked the friend whose shoulders I had grabbed if she felt anything strange while I was sitting against the wall about ten feet behind her. She said that she had in fact had a strange sense that I was coming up behind her and that her shoulders had tensed up, sending a chill down her spine. She discounted it at the time, but upon hearing my trip, she became overwhelmed and had to leave the room. She had taken no drugs of any kind and was sitting comfortably when she says she felt me come up behind her. I never moved, nor said anything the whole time I was tripping but she actually felt the being which I controlled touch her back. <br><br>
Nothing like this has ever happened to me on salvia, but I feel that it holds great power which can be harnessed to learn about myself and soul. The next time I smoke salvia, I am going to set up something which can prove or disprove my ability to affect the material world from within my psyche. I will set something on a table which can be knocked over easily but not accidentally. Nothing I have just stated has been made up or embellished, I am simply stating everything as it happened. Take this for what you will and go into a salvia experience ready for anything and comfortable with anything. Sorry for the lengthiness of this post but I feel it was necessary to fully encompass what this meant to me.<!-- End Body -->
