 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI am currently attending college, so it's fairly often that I will go back to my hometown and stay there for a weekend or so. Me and my best friend went home at the same time one weekend and she had some friends that were mentioning something about trying Crystal Meth the last time she was there. I am game for trying new things usually because I have tried my fair share of more hardcore drugs like Ecstasy and Cocaine, so I thought trying Speed wouldn't be such a bad alternative either.\r\nShe called me the Friday I got into town and told me that she tried that stuff they do in that movie 'Spun', which is a movie about a bunch of Crank addicts. I wasn't too shocked of course cause she had mentioned it before, but that just made me want to try it even more. I didn't really think much of it and continued with my weekend. \r\nWe planned to drive back to our college on Sunday night, and on the drive up she mentioned to me that she had bought a bag of Speed for approximately 20 dollars, I don't remember the size of the bag. Of course, since she mentioned it, I felt like she was a very good friend because she was thinking of me and how I wanted to try it. So of course she mentioned, 'Well we can do some at a rest stop and continue driving.'\r\nSo she takes the bag out of her wallet and surprisingly, there was very little in it. They looked like clear sharp jagged pieces of glass. The people she bought it with were familiar with Crystal Meth so she knew that she was getting high quality because of the clear color of the product, and it was said to be 'probably the best crank I've seen/tried' by one of them. So she took out a credit card and begin to crush the little pieces of glass looking substance. She made two small lines and told me they would last us a while. From watching the movie 'Spun' it was under my impression that it would be like Cocaine, you have to do a little every 15-20 minutes to feel something. But since there was so little, I didn't know what to expect.\r\nSo I was a little nervous, but she rolled up a dollar and I went ahead and sniffed it. After approximately 3 seconds of inhaling, I felt this sharp burning sensation in my nose which I found very, very unpleasant. So I waited for a sensation, and I really didn't feel anything. The burning had stopped after a minute or so and this acrid taste dripped into the back of my throat. She did her line, then we continued driving.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] \r\nAs we were driving, I reported that I didn't feel anything really. No excitement or stimulation besides the burning in my throat. She said that she felt the same and that it was different the first time she did it. She suggested that we should probably do another line, and after that we pulled into the next rest stop and she crushed the rest of the bag and made two very big lines. Now this looked a little more appealing. I figured, 'How bad could this be?' I snorted the whole fat line, and waited a second. All of a sudden this horrible pain began in the upper right side of my brain. This was a pain I had never felt before in my life. My nose and throat never hurt so bad. I had tears coming out of my eyes and streaming down my face like I was intentionally crying, but I wasn't. That was horrible. \r\nYet, right after that, I felt this light airy feeling, this feeling of 'Oh my gosh. This is fabulous.' I just kept saying, 'Wow'. This is the feeling I thought Cocaine would give me when I tried it. This is what I wanted, an intense euphoria. I could feel my body tingling and I felt like I couldn't sit still. This sucked because we were in a car driving on the highway at night, but even so, I had a great time. Me and my friend had to drive back for about 4 hours or so, and after that point I could not stop talking. We kept comparing our weekends and telling stories about the people we know. It felt like the conversation wouldn't stop. I just wanted to keep talking and talking and I ended up talking so much that I would cut off stories by telling other stories.\r\nI felt so happy to have friends and family and to be in school and I couldn't believe how optimistic I felt. And optimism is definately something I lack at times. I especially felt greatful for my best friend who was driving, because she told me she wanted to experience this with me and that touched me deeply. I felt emotional at points as well. I have taken Ecstasy before, and that drug is supposed to make you feel the same way, but I don't think I've ever thought of things in that perspective before until I tried Meth. \r\nSo after a while, she pulled into a rest stop and I drove the rest of the way home. We talked the whole time and got back into town around 1 AM. After that, we parked and hung out in her room and talked bullshit until 7 am. I couldn't believe we were still talking, but of course I noticed the drug wasn't nearly as intense as it was at first, and I felt kind of weird, like it was working in waves. I would feel weird for a moment, then ok again. I felt tired at one point but I believed I wouldn't physically be able to sleep. Yet that main dizzying feeling remained the whole time. \r\nAt around 8 am we went to get her something to eat. I had no appetite whatsoever. I felt kind of strung out at that point as well, like I wanted this weird feeling to go away. After that she took me to my room and I tried to go to sleep for a while. I almost got a little freaked out though while I was lying in my bed trying to go sleep. I could feel my heart pumping very hard and fast through my chest, I noticed that I had been clenching my jaw all night and that it was sore now. My head had this weird tingling feeling, it felt like my brain was frying. I kept seeing weird dark shapes when I closed my eyes. It was strange! I wanted to smoke some weed and go to sleep but I couldn't do that with my room mate in the room. Yet after I got in a more comfortable position, I ended up getting 3 hours of sleep before I had to go class.\r\nI still felt crappy for the rest of the day for a very long time, almost the whole day. In total, I didn't eat anything because I didn't feel hungry at all which just amounted to some queasy feeling. I got a total of 3 hours of sleep in a span of 30 hours. I couldn't believe how powerful this drug was. I must say that I am going to probably try it again because it really did offer me a fun feeling of euphoria that I have been looking for, but I will probably do it earlier in the day so this doesn't happen. I did feel kind of cranky too, like all that optimism and sense of happiness was just gone at that point. Overall the most unpleasant feeling was the burning and 'crashing' which was gradual. I don't want to get hooked on Meth, and I probably won't because I do have self control. Yet I have to say it is rather addictive in the sense that it does give me some confidence.\n\n\n"
