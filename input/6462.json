 "report": "<p>\nThis adventure took place over a weekend spent in the mountains of West Virginia at a festival.  On the way there K and I smoked 2 joints.  It took about five hours.  </p><p>Before I get to the festival I should talk about a dream I had that day.  The previous night I had eaten some syrian rue.  I had the most vivid dream in my life (I regularly have lucid dreams, this blew them all away).  I was making tuna at work when I went outside and sat on the steps of the elementary school next door.  A girl I knew from middle school came up to me and started talking to me.  Just basic small talk, until her mother showed up (I've never met her mother) and they both started telling me, with increasing lividness, that I couldn't go to the festival.  Having just finished my cigarette, I told them to fuck off and started walking back to work.  They tried to follow me, but I ran.  I was back making the tuna when the girl showed up in the room with two black guys wearing those Nation of Islam hats.  They were about to attack me when I realized it was friday night and I should be at the festival, not at work.  Then I was suddenly at home on friday afternoon and I was really paranoid that my friends would forget me.  I tried calling them but no one answered.  I then ran out of my house and down the street where I saw them all packed into a car.  Then I was in the back seat of the car with a guy I'd never met before driving while the owner of the car sat in the passenger's seat.  I told them I needed to get back to my house to get some stuff.  As we turned onto my street it wasn't there, just some random street I'd never seen.  We drove past a street called Wild Orchard (maybe Orchid) Rd, when we drove passed a bus with a painting hanging across the front of it that had oranges and said California, when I realized that the bus driver couldn't see because of the painting the dream ended and I woke up.  Now on to the festival...</p><p>There were four of us, K and I in his car.  We got there first.  R and W were picking up some vials and were much delayed.  We had intended to do the acid that night, but since R and W didn't show up until the next afternoon, all we had was about a dime of weed, some Salvia, a gram of shrooms (which we never took), and about 50g of syrian rue.  We smoked the weed, ate about 5 grams of rue each, then smoked some of the Salvia.  As soon as I finished two walls of constantly color-shifting snake enveloped me, this lasted less than a minute.  We finally went to sleep around 4.  We woke up feeling like we had slept for days on beds made of clouds, instead of 5 hours in a Camaro (syrian rue is awesome).  </p><p>Later that day some guy parked next to us needed a jump for his battery. After we jumped his car he offered us some KB with Hash on top.  It was nice.  He was desperately trying to unload half a pound of it.  He ended up giving us half an ounce for 100 bucks (he was pretty gone:).  Anyway, on to the main part of this tale...</p><p>Our friends finally showed up with four vials.  They traded one for an ounce of opium.  I took 8 hits at 6:00 pm.  Then we smoked a bowl of opium (God!  That was niiiice).  I stood staring down the hill when the acid kicked in after about 20 minutes.  The field stared changing colors and my mind warped to infinty (that's the only way I can describe it, sorry).  I saw my mind started warping around invisible points.  The next thing I recollect is it being night and we have a campfire going.  I feel peak after peak after peak after peak.  I keep saying things like 'we're throughly fucked now!'.  This is where I forgot that I had taken drugs. Then the universe collapsed and my whole life went in reverse.  I then realized that K and I were the two entities who had created the universe and it had expanded and contracted an infinite number of times.  I had forgotten while he had remembered.  I had to remember the primal secret before the universe could die and be reborn, but couldn't.  </p><p>'Is it fire?' I said</p><p>'No' K replied</p><p>'Pantera?'</p><p>'No'</p><p>'Metal?'</p><p>'No'</p><p>And so on.  Occasionally I would come back from the beginning and end of the universe and see a car, which I thought was mine in the year 2039.  I thought I had crashed and was dead.  At one point I looked over and saw someone I didn't recognize, thinking he was a paramedic, I asked him what happened.  'Some kid took drugs and drove.' was his reply.  I then thought I was that kid and was out of my body, which was dead in the car.  This didn't freak me out though, because I knew I had helped to create the universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Salvia was in my pocket.  I don't exactly know what I did with it, but it wasn't there when I stopped tripping.  I either smoked it and that's what brought me to genesis, or I threw the vial into the fire, or I poured it out and tossed the vial.  I also remember climbing up a beach towards a massive grey futuristic fortress and some other random hallucinations.  When I came out of it I was shattered.  I had absolutely believed that K and I had created the universe.  I kept asking him what happened.</p><p>When I accepted that I was just a person we sat around smoking opium the rest of the night.  I was somewhat afraid that I had burned myself, because sometimes when I stopped hallucinating, I was really close to the fire, and I was also loaded with opium and wouldn't notice if I had.</p><p>Since then I've been a different person, I used to be extremely lazy.  Now I don't bitch about doing things, and actually enjoy every minute of every day.  I feel like I've been cleansed of the negative personality traits I used to have.  I feel so alive.</p>"
