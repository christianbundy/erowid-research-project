This started out as a small story about ketamine, but giving it a bit of background for context made it more about roles that both alcohol and ketamine have played in my life. <br><br>
My parents visited me for xmas when I was 30. I had reached the point in my relationship with them where I was tired of their cruelty but I wasnt quite over seeking their approval. So I endured their visit. We spent part of an evening drinking glasses of wine, with me listening to my dads same old story of how disappointed he is in me and how Ive wasted my life and am practically destitute and on the streets. (I am very happy and well-adjusted, thank you, Im just a bit of a freak compared to his growing-up-during-WWII ways.) Battling with my demons, loosened up by the alcohol, I crumpled into pain and tears. Nothing new here.<br><br>
The next few days, I systematically drank my way through the alcohol that was left over from the xmas party Id held at my house that week. I was flagellating myself with booze, enmeshed in my dads trip, trying to resolve my feelings by smearing them into a messy pile. It was pointless. I had learned it from him at home, before I was even old enough to discern what hitting the bottle was. I dove into a good novel, and swam around in the morass of bad feelings.<br><br>
The morning when I was to return to work, I broke down and called my best friend, to tell her about how my xmas had gone terribly wrong. She instantly knew what was up. As I blubbered on the phone to her, I poured myself glasses of white wine, even though it was still morning. Then I poured myself shots of liquor. This was pretty much out of character. I was a well-respected professional working in a drug education-related field at the time. I apparently had decided on some level to work out some self-abuse karma with the help of a cheap and legal intoxicant. As soon as I got off the phone I fell in a swoon on the bed. I got up periodically over the next five hours to throw up in the toilet. I was trying to get it all out, all the bad feelings that Id swallowed for so long, that I didnt know what to do with. On the surface this seems like nonsense now, but my actions had a delicate logic all their own; in the privacy of my own apartment, I could enact any drama I wanted. Growing up in a household that frowned on emotional outbursts of any kind, I had never learned how to properly manage my feelings. It was like not learning the alphabet. People can go through life pretty much hiding that theyre illiterate; I was going through life hiding that I didnt know the first thing about normal human emotions (well, hiding it from most people). And I was bursting at the seams.<br><br>
I made it to work the next day, with a wicked hangover, feeling sluggish and dull. Some time during the day the thought hit me, I have some ketamine. Ill do some ketamine tonight.<br><br>
I went home and felt the first shred of hope and productivity that I had felt in a week. I peeled vegetables and made a yummy soup for myself, and cleaned my kitchen and the rest of the apartment. (I try to get all my affairs in order before every intentional experience with a psychoactive.) Then I got out my fat headphones, my down comforter, my fluffy pillows, and a mix CD a friend had made me for doing ketamine, which included stuff from K&amp;D sessions (I still dont know the exact playlist, which is really a shame). <br><br>
Now, about 48 hours after the beginning of the most severe part of the drinking binge, I insufflated roughly 50 mg of ketamine and lay back in the dark, with the headphones on, snuggled under my comforter. I let myself be carried gently into a place where I was floating free from all my messy emotions, a place where I gathered perspective on them with gentleness and compassion for myself. Shadowy visuals that moved slowly in seemingly pre-arranged patterns like a conveyor belt in a giant factory accompanied the rearranging of my mental and emotional building blocks. I dont feel an anthropomorphic presence while on ketamine, I feel like a part of a giant machine that is also a giant space that is both benevolent and removed from human experiences. Its a place I can go to help reset my clock. I feel that other psychedelic experiences have reset my clock before, too, but low doses of ketamine have done it in a way that I dont have to struggle to get. Theyre predictable, and theyre not difficult at all to integrate, and fit into my normal schedule. <br><br>
The music was like the water of a warm bath, the ketamine was the soothing bath salt. I came out refreshed, renewed, and grateful for a tool to help me face my own demons with compassion and objectivity.<br><br>
Ive experienced this antidepressant effect of ketamine before, while in the throes of hormone-mediated melancholy and frustration that I sometimes get in the middle of my menstrual cycle. <br><br>
I prefer to space my ketamine experiences far apart, and regard them as special sessions to treat with reverence. Otherwise theyre just a way to get fucked up, like alcohol with a weird twist. And I dont find it as fun to get fucked as I used to. I guess getting fucked up is part of an old unhappy unhealthy pattern, like at the beginning of this story. And my little doses of ketamine are like an antidote.<!-- End Body -->
