 "report": "</p>[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>After a five and a half hour shift at my place of employment, a bottle store/wine warehouse, I decided to drop the 20 odd mg of 4-ACO-DMT that had been lingering in my stash for around a week. It had been burning a hole in my pocket and I had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to try it. </p><p>I orally consumed the dosage at 4.25pm, after picking up a few packets of nangs (nitrous) at a supermarket. I then drove home and stopped in at work to pick up my forgotten lunch on the way. Initial effects were felt within 20-30 minutes: a slight element of nausea and a sense of anticipation. I was peaking by about 5.20pm. The effects were of extreme euphoria, walking around and dancing felt great. It was very body-orientated. I had a slight case of the giggles, everything seemed mildly humorous, although from a detached sort of perspective. I listened to a few tracks of the latest Prometheus album (psytrance) Corridor of Mirrors, and experienced sound distortions and alterations typical to tryptamines. By this point (5.40) the visuals became more pronounced and were also of classic tryptamine quality. I went into my backyard and inhaled 2 chargers of nitrous. </p><p>The nitrous intensified the visuals, at the experience was similar to nitrous on 2cb although a bit more intricate and vivid. Lots of hues of purple/yellow/green. The audio effects were pretty much identical to that of nitrous and LSD although I did experience synaesthesia which was quite entertaining. By this point The Mars Volta had replaced Prometheus. I cracked open a beer, and had a few more hits of nitrous, which yielded visuals much more intense than the previous hits and seemed very similar to this although of different colours. It also had a more organic feel to it. It definitely felt like an entity vaguely resembling the form in the link was searching or reaching out to me. I was sitting on my chair in front of my computer with an idiotic grin plastered across my face. I felt great and awed at once.</p><p>I then changed the music to progressive psytrance and began to run a bath. At this point (6pm) I had a bong of cannabis with a slight amount of tobacco (Im trying to stop using tobacco and cannabis simultaneously and cut down on cannabis altogether) which gave a slight treat to my nicotine deprived cells as well as providing a fuzzy feeling on top of the existing body high of the 4ACO. I then had a small bump of Ketamine.</p><p>(6:20pm)Lowering myself into the bath was divine. All my senses were heightened. Tea-light candles littered the edge of the bath, incense was burning. I had a cold beer by my side. My small CD-player in the bathroom was the only slight downside, Im a bit of a pretentious audio-fiend and the distorted quality of the trance was a bit painful. Yet the lovely body-high and gorgeous visuals caused me to not worry about it and go with the proverbial flow. I had a few hits of nitrous which caused similar contacts to those described above, however with the added spice of K the physical effects of the gas were greatly increased. It felt like a spiritual orgasm. The hot water, cold beer, bent tunes (I was too blissful to care about the low quality of my stereo) and happy gas all came together and formed immensely enjoyable sensations. </p><p>I got out to have another bump of K and another bong hit and to get a fresh beer. I spent another forty minutes in the tub with a few more hits of nitrous then got out.</p><p>By this point my mother had arrived home. (7:10pm) fortunately for me we have a close relationship and she has been through similar experiences in her prime, and she is not judgmental in any way and although she may not approve of some of my choices, she is supportive of me nonetheless. I am in great debt to her. We conversed and joked around and ordered some pizza and ate it together. While eating I amused myself by watching television (I usually avoid the moron-box) and silently mocking the travel show that was playing. Everything about it seemed to epitomize everything I loathe about consumer culture. The way the shots were structured together to make it appear like everything was happening in real-time. The acting was shoddy at best. It also enforced race stereotypes by having the Zorba song playing while a Greek chef prepared a lobster. It was also glowing rather strangely. I enjoyed it on two mental levels, one of them was able to pick apart the cinematic and advertising techniques while the other was simply aesthetically amused by the colours of it.</p><p>After dinner (8.00pm) I cleared up the candles from the bathroom and emptied the bath-water onto my garden. We endure water restrictions here in Australia, and rightly so. However its all too little too late and Im not going to begin a rant about it here. This took me about forty minutes to do, factoring in breaks for another beer and changing the music occasionally. I then had another bump of K and hit of nitrous, cracked another beer and went for a walk to my local park. </p><p>(9:00pm)I experienced the usual affinity for nature during my walk, the trees in the park appeared very friendly and pretty. By the time I arrived home I could feel myself coming down, and I was also halfway drunk. I listened to music for about half an hour and then prepared a large line of K. As I shifted my CD-wallet onto my bed my headphone cord (which is very long because they are Sennheisers) dragged the CD-case I had the line racked up on onto the ground. I salvaged a few specks here and there but the nice tasty line had dissipated into the ether. I swore and cursed myself for a few minutes then decided it was probably for the best as I was quite drunk and was doing research on here regarding the effects of K and alcohol together. I then finished the remainder of my nitrous (I forgot to mention Im an utter nangwhore) which yielded a great experience. My mouth hung agape and my head was thrust back to hang over the back of my chair. </p><p>Music struck that funny place in the back of the head and in the third eye. I almost moaned in pleasure. I then crawled into bed and read a few pages of a book before settling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Overall a very good experience, although I probably drank a bit too much.</p>"
