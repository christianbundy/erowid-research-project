I was browsing through the caffeine vault and noticed the estimated fatal dose in humans is one to four grams, depending on body weight and tolerance. More than half a decade ago in high school, I had a terrible overdose experience, among the most unpleasant of my life. <br><br>
At the time, I was an inexperienced novice drug user. As a child, I could drink a 12-pack of cola and not feel any stimulant effects whatsoever. I began taking Vivarin in moderate doses (three or four pills) at school to initiate a pseudo-mania state of mind or to mimic the effects of crystal meth (so I thought). On April Fools Day, I was bored and took four Vivarin during a lunch period on an empty stomach. Having taken the same number of pills the previous week with no side effects, I was confident that exceeding this dose slightly would have no consequences. Approximately twenty minutes later, I popped four more. <br><br>
When lunch period ended, I headed for class with a mild stomachache. I wasnt aware what I had gotten myself into and assumed it would take care of itself. Within ten minutes, I knew something was seriously wrong when the nausea grew worse. Some of my classmates began to show concern as I no longer could contain myself to act like a civilized student and displayed symptoms of physical discomfort. My body was burning, sweating, and shaking uncontrollably and the room became a dizzy spin.<br><br>
Luckily, we werent doing much in class, and I asked my teacher if I could call my mother because I felt sick. He granted permission and gave me advice not to trust cafeteria food. As I waited outside for my ride, I spewed out yellow vomit. When my mom arrived, I still had the urge to throw up. I lied to her about my illness and blamed it on the cafeteria food. Having no significant prior history of drug abuse, she believed me. Once or twice (I dont remember exactly) she pulled over to let me puke.<br><br>
My sickness grew even worse when I came home. I cancelled my drum lessons and went straight to bed with a bucket near me. You can imagine the amount of sleep I got was next to none. My parents were convinced it was food poisoning, but I knew the truth. I called my girlfriend at the time for comfort since I felt she would understand being fairly knowledgeable about drugs. When I informed her what was going on, she initially thought it was an April Fools joke since it was April 1st. It didnt take her long to figure I was in a state of delirium and sheer agony. Boy, I sure wish I were joking.<br><br>
I puked and dry-heaved many times over, more than I ever have that night. Uncontrollably shaking, I mumbled and pleaded for the misery to go away, but it didnt for at least twelve hours. It was a slice of purgatory torment. I dont think I came close to dying, but I definitely came to the realization how simple caffeine, if not taken as directed, can make you really sick.<br><br>
Since that crazy night on April Fools Day, more than six years later, I still have a strong sensitivity to caffeine. Now I easily feel the psychoactive stimulant effects from only drinking one cola, but I suppose this is normal. I believe while drugs generally cause a person to develop a tolerance, substances also have the potential to induce a reverse tolerance if taken in extreme.<!-- End Body -->
