 "report": "<p>This is an account of my experience of T. peruvianus, it is described to the best of my ability. Although I have a fairly good recollection of the event, its not all that clear so here goes.</p><p>It started on a Sat. morning when me and some friends hiked over to a nearby state park to go camping for the night. It was around 12:30 when we got there and started to unpack. The first thing we did was divide up the cactus I had just received in the mail from an online supplier. The cacti was T. peruvianus, and it was ONLY the 1 cm of dried green tissue, just under the 'skin' layer of the cactus. This part of the cactus, so I was told, contained almost all of the mescaline found in the cactus. Therefore, when you read the other peoples' accounts of eating the cactus, they are in fact eating this portion of the cactus so they achieve effects, however it is unnecessary to eat the rest.</p><p>Anyway, back to my story. We divided up the 45g bag 4 ways, there were about 75 small 'chips' of cactus tissue in the bag, so we just counted off 18 pieces each. I then ate nine of these 18 pieces over the course of the next 45 min. The pieces of cactus are tough and very bitter, but if you just crunch it up into small pieces, you can swallow it like a pill, its not that bad at all.</p><p>I finished up the 9th piece at around 1:30 or so. I didn't feel any nausea at this point, and nothing else could be noted except a small 'disconnected-ness' not unlike low levels of a M.J. high. Speaking of M.J., me and my friends decided it was time to pack some bowls full of that sticky green bud we like to call MJ, I think we smoked somewhere in the realm of 5 or six med. sized bowls between the 4 of us over the next 2 hours.</p><p>At this point I didn't feel anything other then a nice high, at because it was my idea to get the cactus in the first place, my friends started saying how they were getting impatient. We all expected to feel some effects within the first two hours, but no one really did. I decided to stick with what I had already consumed and wait it out a little longer, but my friends ate the rest of their portions of the T. peruvianus.</p><p>The next 3 hours (from about 4-7) were what I would call the threshold effect stage. We had a lantern hanging from the top of the tent and when I looked at it and focused a certain way, it looked as big as a person. Also, when outside in the woods, I was very sensitive to all of the reds and greens, they all looked so rich and vibrant. I also felt an indescribable connection to the forest, it was compelling and seemed now more beautiful then ever before.</p><p>I decided to go on a little walk by myself through the woods. I found a nice little hill that was exposed to the sun so I went and sat cross legged on top of it in the short grass. As soon as I closed my eyes, I saw very interesting visuals though closed eyes. I would describe this type of hallucination as 'looking through the mind's eye' I saw people I knew, trees, water, all types of things, all of them were life like</p><p>I must stop and say something at this point, it was my observation that this is the type of drug that you have to really be in the mood for, you can't just sit back and let it do all the work for you like shrooms, you actually have to have a certain state of mind to have a great trip.</p><p>After a little while, I walked back to the tent and asked my friends how they were feeling. They all said that they felt something, but not anything close to what I was experiencing (I think it's because they were in the right state of mind). Anyway, I ate a big fat bowl of some really good beef stew that we made before we left, it tasted better then anything I had ate before, and I filled my stomach up to the brim. I didn't ever experience any nausea or cramping the whole time. As it was getting dark, the peak set in and it was a horrible time for that to happen.</p><p>At about 7 it started to drizzle and get dark at the same time, we all panicked to clean everything from dinner up and then get everything in the tent so that it wouldn't get soaked. I started to get really freaked out when it got pitch black. When I looked into the darkness of the forest, I saw a big pair of eyes looking right back at me. Also, I thought I heard a huge animal running behind me getting closer and closer, I totally shrieked and jumped back in horror, but it wasn't hard to just say to myself 'OK, its only your imagination' which was really calming.</p><p>That's another thing I recommend, if and when you get freaked out, just do something to keep yourself busy like collect firewood, that way you won't concentrate so much on what's bugging you.</p><p>I felt bad for my friends (the ones that ate twice as much as me) because they were just as freaked as me but they couldn't calm themselves down like I could. Here's one more thing to remember if you try this stuff, don't touch any person who is tripping on this stuff, they will get really freaked out by the sensation.</p><p>I peaked from about 8-10, I just got all snuggled up in my sleeping bag and watched the light show. This is the part I can't remember too well, I thought a lot about my life and thought about my problems and how I can be a better person and stuff like that. I was having fun now. It just felt so free and liberating, it was awesome.</p><p>It's a good experience. Just be in a place that you are comfortable with and be around people you know, love, and trust-otherwise you will not be having fun at all. This is definitely not a party drug, or a rave drug, its a chill-time drug, but I think it might be fun at a concert.</p><p>Anyway, just use caution and have fun. Write your experience when your done. I hope I helped some people out there.</p><p>peace</p>"
