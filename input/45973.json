 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm very experienced with both shrooms and Soma, but for some reason it never occurred to me to combine them. On a Friday night I found myself alone with no distractions and decided to eat the remaining 1.5 or so grams of shrooms I had left and I also ate 2 350 mg tablets of Soma. I hadn't eaten for several hours and hadn't had any Soma for over a week, so I was execting liftoff to hapen rather quickly. \r\nI played some video games to pass the time while I waited for the medicine to kick in and sure enough about 15 minutes after ingesting my shroom/Soma cocktail, I got the familiar Soma buzz with the accompanying emotional comfort. It normally takes longer for shrooms to take effect for me so I continued playing video games. Below is a timeline:\r\nT+0:15: \r\nSoma kicks in. I'm feeling very good, nice warm Soma buzz. \r\nT+0:20: \r\nI get up to get a soda and I sway noticeably when I walk to the fridge. Soma feels good. All the benefits of being drunk and no nausea! \r\nT+0:30: \r\nStill in the 'coming up' phase with the Soma, I know I'll be peaking in the next few minutes. I'm wondering when the shrooms will kick in. I hope it's soon. \r\nT+0:45: \r\nMy girlfriend calls. She's gorgeous, exotic and very sexy but she doesn't approve of recreational drug use, so I'm having fun trying to talk to her and not let her notice I'm totally fucked up and peaking on Soma. I tell her she woke me up. I'm thinking too bad she's not at my apartment right now because I'm pretty horny. Soma does that to me sometimes.\r\nT+1:00: \r\nThe shrooms have kicked in and I'm in my coming up period. I feel a little nausea and some excitement, can't tell if it's anxiety or anticipation. I decide it's the natural effects from coming up on shrooms. \r\nT+1:30: \r\nThe nausea has gone away and I'm experiencing everything in that dreamy shroom way. I notice the shapes of things and I say out loud, 'Geometry is my friend'. Think about it, if it weren't for geometry, there'd be no shapes. I especially like triangles at this time. I think about putting on some Pink Floyd from the Sid Barret years, but my friend Chuck calls and we talk for a few minutes. I remember thinking I wish I had more shrooms to eat tonight. It would have been better to have three grams of shrooms, but it's still nice. \r\nT+2:00: \r\nPeaking on shrooms and the Soma is still going nicely. I decide out of curiosity to check my blood pressure and see if the shrooms have an effect. I like to experiment with this kind of thing. My BP is about 20 points higher on both the top and bottom figure. I'm not sure if it's the excitement or the shrooms that cause it to be higher than normal. It's not dangerously high though, (155/92) so I'm not worried.\r\nT+2:25: \r\nI'm feeling extremely horny. Maybe hornier than I've ever felt in my life, so I make the mistake of putting some porn in the DVD player. Big mistake because this makes me even hornier yet to my dismay, it appears the shrooms and the Soma combo have made it nearly impossible to 'enjoy my own company'. On both of these substances I have no problem when I use them alone. Together though, I'm trying to unlock a door with a wet noodle and this combination of Soma and shrooms makes me really want to unlock that door!\r\nT+2:45: \r\nI decide to try to go to sleep and have some nice shroom dreams. No dice. Now I'm too horny from the drugs and porn to sleep. I'm glad my girlfriend didn't come over because I wouldn't be able to perform. I'd still be able to pleasure her but she'd feel bad and worry because I've never had erectile difficulty before. \r\nSometime after this I fell asleep. I later talked to a friend of mine and he confirmed that on shrooms alone he's had the experience of not being able to raise the flagpole. I'm using euphemisms here because I'm not sure how explicit I can be in sexual terms. At any rate, it appears I'm not alone in this experience. I don't think I'll combine these two drugs again. It felt phenomenal, but it was also extremely frustrating.\n\n\n"
