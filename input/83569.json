 "report": "<p>Pill:  at first tastes a bit sour, then more like a walnut.  Not a super strong taste.  No noticeable change in color of tongue or urine.</p><p>Ok it's been a few minutes now and it hasn't fully dissolved yet.  I'm taking this opportunity to look up miracle fruit on Wikipedia.</p><p>Ok its been like 10 minutes.  I hope the patience pays off.</p><p>Ok done</p><p>Orange:  I'm picking this first because it's the least strong in terms of sourness and I don't want to mess up my taste buds for later.  Kinda like how you start wine tasting with a white.  Although it would be cool to jump straight to hot sauce and see how great it is, but I don't want to climax prematurely here.</p><p>Ok the orange tastes more or less the same, but just really really good.  Like almost artificially good like an orange fruit snack.  If I didn't have more to taste I'd eat this whole orange (and I just had dinner so I'm not hungry).   The aftertaste is just of orange.  That was yummy.  Time to move on.</p><p>Lime:  Ok I'm laughing hysterically now.  I am a believer.  Before I tasted it the juice got into a little crack in my lip and burnt and I thought, uh oh this is gonna be bad.  Its burning bad so I know this is a normal lime.  It tastes amazing though.  Again, like a fruit snack.  I'm giggling.  </p><p>Lemon:  I just ate the whole thing.  My stomach burns haha.  Wikipedia said it doesn't change the chemistry of the food, so the acid is still there.  I'm also burping and I never burp.</p><p>Onion:  Ok time for the big guns.  Wow my stomach burnssssss.  Ok it smells like onion, but it has no taste.  It's like unflavored yogurt.  So definitely a remarkable change, but it's not sweet like the other things have been.  I would suggest this for when you are going to eat somewhere and you know it's going to be bad.</p><p>Sugar Cube:  Not much flavor.  Could have been overpowered by the onion.  Should have eaten that first but I forgot.  I'm licking the lemon juice off my lips and its yummy.</p><p>Jose Cuervo Especial:  I don't really like tequila.  It tastes different.  I still don't like it.  It tastes more earthy, wooden, or maybe fried chicken.</p><p>70 something % dark chocolate:  tastes the same.  Maybe it's wearing off.  Nope it's not I just went back to the lime and it still tastes like getting a paycheck.</p><p>Peri-peri African pepper sauce: not much change.  Maybe a little less spicy.  </p><p>E&J Very Special Old Pale Superior Reserve (Sounds fancy but it was $8 and came with a flask!): I don't drink enough brandy to know what this is supposed to taste like normally.  I can say for sure that this is better than the tequila was.</p><p>Water: no change</p><p>Honey: no change</p><p>What little lemon is left still tastes about 75% as good as before, so that's a good way to make sure it hasn't worn off.  </p><p>Uggggghhh stomach ache.</p><p>When it comes to super acidic things, just because you can, doesn't mean you should.  Stop after ½ of a lemon or something.</p>"
