 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAs many know yabba is not widely available in Europe and in general the Western world. We got our tiny friends in Southern Thailand - out on the Islands.\r\nHaving been warned by other travellers and locals that Yabba when ingested can be a 3 day event, and can cause some pretty seriously strong E/Acid effects we desided to do what had been suggested and smoke it. The tablets we got were small  and red - probably half the size of your average E, I chased (on tin foil) a 1/4 of a tablet - the smoke was easy to take and almost tasteless - the hit came on in just a few minutes. I find it hard to discribe the mind set - it was kind of like doing coke without the raring to go feeling, I felt good about myself and had the felling of well being and control, also talkative and alert. I had no adverse feeling at all and felt high for at least a couple of hours - around 3 hours later I smoked another 1/4, I could still feel the 1/4 I had taken earlier on, however once I had smoked the next quarter I realised I had come down more that I had 1st thought and the original high came on very quickly and was stronger, it was again strong for at least 3 or 4 hours.\r\nYabba is an interesting drug - I didn't fancy ingesting it and from the carnage I saw in Thailand probably better to smoke unless you fancy a few days on the go!\n\n\n"
