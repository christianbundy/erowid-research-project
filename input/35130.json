 "report": "<p>I started using GHB in 1998, everyone was talking about it and I'd only vaguely heard of it so I researched it. The more I read the more excited I got because it sounded like a genuine alternative to the other drugs I would use, at the time that was amphetamines (not meth) ecstasy, cocaine, occaisonally benzos and alcohol. All those drugs were just too toxic for my liking so I ordered 25 grams of powder GHB from a South African company. When it arrived I was cautious and took small (1 gram) amounts and gradually worked up to 2.5 which I found optimal. </p><p>The effects were incredible, absolute euphoria which didn't feel sinister or toxic, great socialising to the point of seeking a social situation followed by the best nights sleep I've ever had. Good for sex too. I felt no need to take it compulsively but I researched wether it was addictive, apparently not, at all. The gaps between doses got closer together until I was having a couple of caps every four hours or so including through the night, I took it everywhere I went and I sourced cheaper GHB kits from Pelchat labs. </p><p>I never thought I was addicted but I would occaisonally nod out, like a narcoleptic and come too just as sudden. I woke up in hospital one night with a bemused nurse staring at me, she told me I'd been out cold and suddenly sat up completely awake and with it. That rattled me and I realised I was dependent, both physically and very much so psychologically. I was happy to live with this addiction but it did sometimes worry me. Only six months or so on I'd moved flats and ran out of G, I couldn't get it anywhere and went into violent withdrawal, in a flat with nothing at all in it. </p><p>I was shaking, sweating profusely and hallucinating wildly, it was like being tortured. I was drinking vodka heavily to mitigate the horrific symptoms but it only really took the edge off. This peaked at day three and again at day 8. After this I was a wreck, I got G when I could and became an alcoholic to deal with the protracted withdrawal symptoms of anxiety which went on and on. I was detoxed three times from alcohol which was never a favourite drug of mine and got addicted to benzos too. The whole story lasted about four years. I turned from a happy go lucky club kid type to a complete wreck. Not clever. You don't know if you're the kind of person who doesn't know when to stop until you can't.</p>"
