 "report": "<p>I've noticed a bit of discussion regarding the combination of MDMA and 2C-B lately within our community. Since I finally had the opportunity to experience it recently, I thought I'd add my impressions to the consensus. I started with 125 mg. MDMA at about 9:45 pm. I then took a 50 mg supplement at the 90 minute mark and another an hour after that. The ecstasy trip was rather typical to my experience of that substance; very warm, lucid and heart-opening. The material was excellent; perhaps not the strongest I ever had, but very clean and smooth. Interestingly, it had a different appearance than any other MDMA I have ever encountered. Most MDMA powder that I have seen has a crystalline look to it, but this was chalkier than usual, almost like talc. </p><p>90 minutes after my final supplement, I took 45 mg. of 2C-B, my largest dose yet. I opted for such a high dose because I had taken some earlier in the week and wanted to compensate for tolerance. It was incredible, amplifying, deepening and extending the emotional warmth of the ecstasy and adding a profoundly psychedelic component to the experience. </p><p>I noticed something new to my experience of 2C-B on this trip -- entities! I was presented with closed-eye visions of strange creatures that looked like a cross between the type of animals that inhabit the deepest, darkest regions of the ocean floor (jellyfish, luminescent eel-like creatures, strange octopoids, etc) and sci-fi style aliens, plus beings that looked remarkably like disembodied eyes. These beings did not seem to have the same sort of urgent sense of presence associated with them that I normally experience during tryptamine-mediated entity contact, however. I also percieved a scene rendered in egyptian motifs in which several humanoid beings that were apparently priests or shamans performed some sort of sacred ritual around a highly elaborate, ornate altar. Egyptian style symbology is something that I often encounter on 2C-B; the bees often send visions of ankhs, pyramids, eyes of Horus and such dancing across the insides of my eyelids. Does anyone else find this common on this material? With eyes open, my entire visual field was in motion and seemingly overlaid with millions of tiny gyrating multi-colored helical structures that reminded me of DNA molecules. I also noticed a wavy disturbance in the air around the outline of my body that looked like the way an area of heat will make a pocket of air look kind of blurry. Could my visual sense have been so heightened to the point that I was actually seeing my own body heat? I wonder... </p><p>This incredible state of consciousness persisted for several hours, and I finally got to bed around 8:00 the following morning, almost eleven hours after I had begun. I felt a little strung out the following day, but this was quite tolerable in light of the previous evening's experience. This combination certainly gets high marks in my book!</p>"
