 "report": "<p>It doesn't seem like many people have a bad exstacy trip, but I did. I was hanging out with two friends, Eric and Dave, by McDonalds. We have no life so thats what we did to pass the time, because we knew people who worked there. Anyway, this guy pulls up to us in his car and asks us if we wanted any E. Thats not exactly how it happened, but I don't want to make this too long or boring. I was the only one with money, so I was the only one who bought a pill. Considering the seedy nature of the dealer, I dont know if it was pure, if at all, MDMA. We went to see the movie From Hell (about Jack the Ripper). Dave kept asking for half of the pill, but I took the whole thing myself. To keep it short heres a basic run down of what happened (and ALOT of things happened):</p><p>I got scared of getting caught because I was way too hyper, so I left maybe 20 minutes into the movie. We bought some weed from some guy, I never saw. That weed 'mysteriously' vanished after the first bowl. I wan't sure where I was. I couldn't stop moving. I kept complaing because I thought I might be dying of dehydration. I kept questioning whether any of this was real or just a hallucination.</p><p>Some symptoms I had were: very quiet things seems excrutiatingly loud. My heart rate was so high, in retrospect I'm surprised I didn't have a heart attack. I was extremely confused. I kept seeing people who weren't there. I could not stop 'chewing' the nothingness in my mouth (it was much like grinding my teeth). My memory and perception of what was happening was completely out of order. I only slept for an hour that night, but never felt tired.</p><p>Now here's an important note: A few months ago I found out that my two 'friends' were taking advantage of my state of mind to have a little fun. They purposely confused me and tricked me, and the whole time laughing while I was freaking out. I had a significant amount of money on me ($80) which I belive they stole. I also believe that the weed 'mysteriously vanishing' was just them taking the weed. After the experience I would randomly make a chomping motion with my jaw, uncontrollably throughout the week. The after effects also lasted for about a week. But the worst part was that for almost a year afterward I would question whether what was happening was real or just a hallucination. At times (esp. shortly after the trip) I was almost positive what was happening wasn't real. The moments I questioned were normal everyday moments.</p><p>I have heard that people can use XTC to help heal emotional problems, but from my experience it seems as if it can create them as well. I can only imagine what would have happened to my mind if I had been caught and arrested while I was on it! Just be with people you know you can trust if you use XTC.</p>"
