 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI'm not very experienced with hallucinogens at all, I've done potent marijuana but nothing even close to Salvia. I did my research on Salvia, and since it was supposed to be a short lasting trip I decided to try it and ordered a 1/2 oz. of leaves. I picked out the largest leaves I had, and prepared my bong and my bowls. My bong has easily interchangeable bowls, and I found out that is very useful for smoking the bowls quickly one after the other.  I had 2 large bowls which I packed each with 2 large crushed leaves, because the whole leaf took up too much space in the bowl. <br>The dark room where I tried it was not a good choice but it was the quietest place I had. It was messy and cluttered, stuff was everywhere, so anyways I sat down at the matress on the floor, and I laid out everything I needed and tried to clear my mind to get myself ready. But I was still nervous because I had never tripped before so I did not know how I would react. I started off with the first bowl, and I quickly realized these bowls were huge because I kept inhaling and the smoke just kept coming and coming. I held it in for at least 40 sec. and while I was holding it in, I changed the bowls and got ready for the next hit, As I was starting to take the second hit I already felt strange, and I was surprised by how quickly it was acting on me. As I took that second hit I started to feel like if I had just done some really potent marijuana, kind of like slight memory lapse, I held in that hit  for 35 sec. but during that time everything changed and I felt like time was standing still, I felt like my perception shifted far back inside me, like everything I was seeing thru my eyes was a movie, or I was watching it on t.v. As I held the bong my arms looked strange and I felt like it wasn't my body I was looking at. I also had the weird sensation that everything I was doing was being controlled by a supernatural force.  <br>I put down the bong and let out that smoke, and all of a sudden it hit me hard, I felt like I didn't know who I was, where I was, or what I was doing. I became really frightened and I looked around me and everything looked cartoonish or artificial... what I saw is some kind of a strange darkened street and I was sitting there on the edge of the sidewalk. The walls on either side of my room weren't there, what I saw was just wide open space to either side of me. It felt like endless space to my left and right. ( I was actually sitting on the edge of a mattress inside my room) When I looked around it also seemed that everything was in 'layers' and I wasn't sure which was the real one. There was also a puzzle-like pattern on top of everything I saw. I didn't know who I was and that thought terrified me, I struggled to remember, and my mind was just overwhelmed, and I couldn't even remember my own name. I'm sure that feeling of amnesia lasted at most a minute or so but it shocked me, afterwards I began to say 'My name is Kris' over and over, but I felt like I didn't believe it, and I was reassuring myself of who I was.<br>I also began to feel the presence of small beings around me, I didn't see them but I got scared that at any moment they would show themselves to me and I also said something like 'Salvia are you there?' I then laid down on the mattress and when I looked up at the ceiling the whole room was undulating and shifting. I closed my eyes and I was seeing moving and shifting patterns, not vividly colored, but reddish tinted patterns. In these patterns among other things, I saw a wheel consisting of 5 people connected from their heads, and I had the feeling that salvia could be used to enter into a different dimensions. As the experience began to subside I was able to think clearly but I felt as though many parts of the experience were undescribable or I couldn't remember them. I got up to reach for a glass of water, and I noticed my balance was off, and I felt kind of wobbly like I was 'drunk'. Within 45 of the experience I was feeling back to normal, except for a slight headache. <br>Overall I was pleased with the experience, I was just shocked by how powerful Salvia is, those small leaves hold a lot of power within them, I would like to try the extract, and I can imagine that will be a truly enlightening experience. Peace Out..\n\n\n"
