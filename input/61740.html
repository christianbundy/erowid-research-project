I'll try to keep the club details to a minimum here because I tend to think it makes for a dull trip report, but it's relevant to the story so bare with me.<br><br>
Last night I went to a club in the UK. I had three MDA windmills and a capsule with 13mg of 2C-B. However I opted out of taking the 2C-B this time as the last few times it's been a bit underhwelming and I ended up being bored (think I left a couple of mg's of powder in the bag when I was trying to snort it). I dropped 1 pill at about 1 AM hoping to come up in time for one of my favourite DJ's, Dave Seaman. Wasn't really feeling it after about an hour (yet my mate was absolutely battered after about 20 minutes) so I took another putting it down to tollerance. Still nothing so I took a third, absolutely desperate to come up before the end of the night. It was about 3.00 and all of a sudden my jaw started rattling all over, shame I had half an hour left and I'd spent the majority of the club being turned upside down practically sober. Tough house and banging dark prog through and through, it was amazing.<br><br>
I got out the club and was pretty wrecked, still coming up. Tried to have a crack on with the taxi driver but he wasn't having any of it so I gave up on him. Got home and started peaking in my bedroom. Loads of utter nonsense flying through my head - MDA all over. The clocks had changed and for some reason I decided this to be a huge head fuck so spent about 10 minutes trying to change the time. Even bigger headfuck, I've got no idea why but I kept going back and trying to adjust the time, then realsing that I was pressing the wrong buttons and forgetting what I was doing all the time. Decided there was no way I was wasting this or going to bed so I got out my mp3 player and racked up 3 lines of ket that I had left (desperately scraped out my bullet). Put two up my nose and put on on a set on my mp3 player.<br><br>
Was feeling nothing after 10 minutes so got the other one up there and sat back. Was feeling pretty good and could see very slight psychedelic patterning at one point from the MDA. My vision also kept doing something that often happens to me on MDA whereby my visual perspective suddenly jumps about an inch in one direction. Sort of like everything in my perspective shifting inbetween frames and happens every time. I shut my eyes and was getting another typical CEV for me on both MDA and Cannabis whereby it seems like I'm travelling down a tunnel, with very slight and not too colourful visuals. The ketamine didn't do a lot for me, it never produced the racey experience that it usually does on MDxx, I didn't have enough left really. It did enhance the MDA and particularly the music however. It was going very nicely, I was very euphoric and loving the music. I remember looking at my ceiling and seeing a sort of moving arrow that looked like it was made of cloud. I also seen some floating orbs reminiscent of an MDA experience I had 3 or 4 years ago which made me very happy thinking about it as that was the night first realised just how much I love MDA. I remember holding my mp3 player with my hand curved over the top and suddenly seeing it as a monkey wearing a cap side ways. Was hallucinating quite a bit now and I noticed that the ket had put me into the very beginings of a mild k-hole, whereby I can sometimes make out dark silhouettes of people without being very far gone. I remember sitting there with eyes shut a couple of times and seeing people that I knews faces appear who would say something to me. I'd then sort of go to respond and realise that they weren't there. Was very fun/confusing, I love being in that state.<br><br>
Seeing as the ket hadn't done a lot I was pretty gutted that it would probably be over farely soon. Then I had an amazing idea, why not empty that gel cap with the 2C-B inside and put it up my nose aswell. So I did. 13 mg of 2C-B up my nose. One thing that I've noticed about snorting 2C-B is that it kicks in practically instantly. It is the second time that I have snorted it then looked down at the carpet a few seconds later and seen typical 2C-B visuals start forming on the carpet as the carpet melts and curls into itself. It's unbelievably fast acting. I lay down in bed again with my mp3 player on, I had my eyes shut and there I was flying down that tunnel once more .<br><br>
I was lying down flying down this tunnel when all over a sudden a colourful bright flow of green swept in at a medium pace from the side of my vision. Here comes the 2C-B I thought and sure enough when I opened my eyes the all too familiar characteristics of 2C-B were really starting to take effect. I shut my eyes and watched the amazing visuals unfold behind my eyelids. When I eventually opened them again a few minutes later it seemed that colourfull vines were weaving out from the side of my head and into my vision. Visuals were weaving themselves into everything in a way that I've never seen on 2C-B or MDA (I've had my vision engulfed with visuals on 2C-B but the MDA seemed to give them a completely different twist to anything I'd seen before). I was now in a very lucid, dreamy state. I remember thinking that it reminded me of how I expected MMDA to be to some extent from what I'd read about its own lucid dream like qualities. These intricit vines of colour were everywhere, I couldn't begin to describe them any better than that. My room was full of vibrant, bright colours moving in strange ways, along with the typical geometric patterns and melting. I kept thinking that people were standing next to me as not only did I keep hallucinating them via visuals but I kept hallucinating their prescence aswell. My mental perspective was so off the rails by now, I was in a different place altogether. <br><br>
It was such a perfect synergy, 2C-B is so lacking mentally there is little to no headfuck at all but the MDA filled the gap very well. Music sounded outstanding and I've already been going into detail about the intricit visuals. I kept shutting my eyes and seeing people, then I realised that they were dancing and in a club. It was dark but the detail was unbelievable and I could make them out very clearly. I seem to remember feeling like I was dancing in there amongst them, it felt amazing. Then people would start talking to me (like earlier on but even more clear) and I'd sort of be having conversations with them in my head, then realising I was just buckled on MDA and 2C-B and forgetting and talking to someone else. It was very confusing but in a fun, comfortable way. I actually thought that all my mates were in the room with me then I'd remember and forget again. I remember wondering where everyone had gone when I started coming round a bit later on.<br><br>
The next couple of hours were a blur, I think I was too far gone to really be concious in the normal sense of the word. I was awake but I didn't really have the capability to remember much of what was going on. I remember realising it was 7 o clock and everyone would be getting up soon, my jaw was rattling like it had a pair of electric prods at either side and I live at home. I took out my earphones and was still getting slight visuals but very much wrecked in side my head, I was in bits. I remember lying in my bed for hours and falling into the same state I always do after MDMA/MDA where I lie there pretty much awake but not with it at all. Then I eventually managed to drift off and woke up later feeling fine.<br><br>
I've heard that MDMA and 2C-B have quite a big cross tollerance and that it's pointless doing them together. I didn't get this with MDA at all, possibly because it involves mixing a more psychedelic substance into the equation. The synergy is a powerfull one, both filling in the gaps where the other ones can lack. The open eye visuals were so out of this world that I can't even begin to describe them, they were like nothing either 2C-B or MDA have ever gave me. The closed eye visuals were also detailed and intense, it wasn't just geometric patterns it was also seeing different places alltogether. The mental effects of both were intensified and the euphoria was amazing. Music sounded absolutely quality and I find it to be an incredible combination that I intend to try again.<!-- End Body -->
