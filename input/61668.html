My life is a train wreck at the time of experamintation. I'm depressed, lost my girlfriend, and started smoking pot. Not to mention I have AS. Also known as aspergers syndrome. That pretty much means I have sensory integration and have a hard time focusing on boring shit. Basically I'm a genius at topics that interest me but dont give a crap about anything else.<br><br>
SI (sensory integration) has made my life a living hell ever sense I was born. I have felt like I couldent even live in my own skin. Until just recently its been almost unbarable. Its starting to disperse now. Clothes no longer bother me. Some noises still do though.<br><br>
Anyways on to my little trip into my mind. The weed ran out so I was looking for another way to get fucked up. Then I heard about diphhydramine. I looked in the medicine cabinate and what do you know I found some sleepinol which has 50 milligrams of it in each pill. I popped about 600 mg worth in that and then I took 2 dryls also just for the hell of it which have 25mg diphhydramine in each. Then I sat back and turned on the tv to watch 24. After about an hour I thought it wasnt going to work so I stood up to get on the computer and the second I stood up I just fell down on the floor. I tried to get up and walk but my balance was to fucked up so I just sat back down. A little later in the trip about 30 minutes later I had to piss real bad so I got up and stumbled over to what I thought was the toilet but the lights were off. I didnt think the lights where off and I thought I was seeing the toilet. I ended up pissing on the floor. The next thing I know im hearing voices narrorating my life. Telling me of the past and the future. I thought this was interesting and wished they would continue but they suddenly stopped. The walls started moving in and out, in and out. I heard a noise sounding like a tornado so I hid in the closet. Then I remembered I'm trippin and I felt really stupid.<br><br>
About 3 and a half hours into the trip I put on some music but I couldent understand anything everytime they said a word I would forget it. About 4 hours into the trip I started seeing little things crawling on my bathroom floor but I ignored it and decided I've experianced all I was going to experiance and it was time to go to bed. On my way to turn off the lights I fell and it took a while to get up. I finally got up and turned off the lights then stubled over to my bed. The next day I still felt sort of intoxicated almost like an alchohol buzz and I still found walking a little difficult but other than that I was fine. No real hangover thank god.<!-- End Body -->
