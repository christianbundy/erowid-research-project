Yesterday my friend J, same age and weight as me came over with some JWH-018. We both are regular cannabis users, have done LSD, Mushrooms, and K2 (grams at a time, trying to trip out off it).<br><br>
We start out trying the JWH by putting a little bit of weed in my bowl and put probably 2-3mg of jwh in and take a couple hits. We don't hold them in long and after 30 minutes are not impressed with our results. We then do about a 5mg dose and have a nice high going, but not going crazy. We decide to do about another 10mg each and both get very high, still not holding that smoke in for very long though. I'd say we have been smoking for over 2 hours and he passes out. He usually passes out cause I have a higher tolerance for everything it seems and he is always tired from work. Anyway, I proceed to smoke another 5mg about and feel good. The walls start to blur a little, my shelves start to zoom in and out, and I start to really get into the music that is on. After consuming a pie from dominos I start coming down and call it a night.<br><br>
The next day we decide were going to give tripping out off JWH another shot. <br><br>
9:00 - We pack my bowl out with around 25mg and he takes it all in and holds it for 30 seconds, then I quickly repack it and do the same. <br><br>
9:02  We both look at each other feeling an intense high come on, we loose perception of time instantly. We are glued to our chairs.<br><br>
9:05  We are both very aware of the high that we are currently enduring and know it is coming on too strong. J keeps saying how fucked we are and I'm panicking. The past 3 minutes felt like an hour. <br><br>
9:15  Intense visual distortion. J can't stand up, I hold onto his arm while listening to music and assure him we're gonna get through it. I tell him we need to do it together and that I can't do it alone. My body feels like a demon is ripping my soul out as my micro nemesis drives chemicals further into my skull. I am loosing hope that J will snap out of it, he is barely responding too me. I am panicking and telling myself over and over that this isn't happening. I ask him if we should go to the hospital and he tells me no.<br><br>
9:20  J's struggles to keep his eyes open, I pace back and fourth as the walls of my room melt around me. I assume I am dying. J struggles to speak and tells me we should go to the hospital and passes out. My head is spinning, I am somehow able to grasp reality and fuck my way back into it. I try to wake J up but he starts to seizure out of control and flail around in the chair. He falls onto the floor and knocks the power out to my computer. I pick him up and lay him against my dresser and stumble out of my room into the hallway.<br><br>
9:25  My father is in the kitchen watching tv, I walk up to him and I am speechless. Forming words for the situation is impossible, all I can say is J is sick. My mother and father are in my room, slapping j and are unable to wake him. My father leaves to call an ambulance and my mother (a nurse) checks his vitals. <br><br>
9:30  J awakens and starts screaming and flailing uncontrollably. My mother and I struggle to hold him down as he lets out blood curdling screams with each breath, his bulging eyes and agonizing facial expression will forever be ingrained in my mind.<br><br>
9:35  The fire chief is the first to arrive on scene with an ambulance, he walks into my room and see's J on the floor with me sitting next to him. My mind is overwhelmed by the presence of such a role model (fire chief, me and J's boss, all round great guy) and I leave the room. <br><br>
9:45  I've been sitting on my couch tripping balls as dozens of familiar faces walk in and out of my house. They all recognize me from J's breakdown last month when his girlfriend left him and he went missing. They all look at me like I just killed my best friend, and then drag him from my room into the living room to put him on the stretcher. He is still screaming and flailing. <br><br>
10:10  I arrive at the hospital, I feel okay and the lingering feeling of dying has dissipated. I rode in the ambulance and watched J vomit and scream while they sedated him. As I sit in the bed the curtains all around me breathe and sway until a doctor comes. <br><br>
10:45  I was released from the hospital, I had no test run or any drugs given too me. J is staying overnight and has had blood drawn and urine samples taken. Before I left I stopped to see him and he was sleeping but mumbling why? and what's going on?. <br><br>
10:55  I tell his parents face to face what happened and why their son is in the hospital cause no one had been able to contact them.<br><br>
This was the single most insane hour of my life. I saw, felt, and did things I never thought I would. I am thankful I didn't OD too, god knows what would have happened. I will probably never do JWH again. Not only was it the most intense drug I have ever done, it was coupled with the most insane event of my life.  I never want to put my parents through that again.<!-- End Body -->
