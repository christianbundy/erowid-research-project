 "report": "<p>December 2002</p><p>Thirty milligrams of N,N-dipropyltryptamine hydrochloride (N,N-DPT hcl)</p><p>Prologue:</p><p>My girlfriend was out of town, my best friend J and I were hanging out for the evening, and we were both looking for something interesting to do that evening.  I tend not to look at psychedelic drugs for recreational highs.  However, for some reason that evening I was in the mood to experiment with one and (hopefully) just have fun.  Not wanting to be up all night, I looked in my arsenal for something short and sweet.  N,N-DPT is what stuck out. Thus N,N-DPT is what I selected.</p><p>The Experience:</p><p>My preferred method of administration for this drug is by intra-muscular injection.  However, my sterile solution was nearly gone and I did not feel like making up another.  Instead, I decided to insufflate the material.  Thirty milligrams was carefully weighed out and I inhaled the strong indolic-smelling compound in a single line.</p><p>As soon as I wiped my nose, J mentioned that he wanted to go bowling.  Bowling was the last thing I figured I would end up doing under the influence of N,N-DPT.  Nevertheless, I was feeling adventurous that night, and after a quick debate in my head, I said Yes.  So off we go with some cash for bowling, a bit of pot for later, and (of course) the thirty milligrams of N,N-DPT up my nose.</p><p>About fifteen minutes after insufflating the N,N-DPT I felt an alert.  It was euphoriastrong euphoria.  I had not experimented with cocaine up to that point.  However, the feeling I had was exactly what I would have imagined a coke-high to feel like.  I was very happy, elated actually, and told my friend of my joy.  The euphoria gradually shifted into an all-out body warmth.  That feeling quickly put a smile on my face.</p><p>When we arrived at the bowling alley, I started to note the more psychedelic effects beginning.  Small visuals were noted, and I felt somewhat hampered when it came time to speaking with the lane-keeper.  But with some effort, I paid for our lane, got shoed up, and picked out my bowling ball.  Next to our lane was a group of rowdy kids, but I did not let that bother me.</p><p>Then the psychedelic effects really began as I moved up to the lane to play.  The visuals were growing EXTREMELY intense, especially for the dosage I took, with everything becoming filled with motion, light, and color.  I turned around, and looked at J and had some funny illusions where his arms and legs were made of bowling pins, his body two bowling balls.  Obviously my setting was influencing my visions.</p><p>I had some doubts that I was going to be able to pull this off, but when it was my turn to bowl, I actually did quite well.  I just focused on what was in front of me, and tried to ignore all else.  In fact, the N,N-DPT seemed to enhance my bowling ability because I scored over 100!  Generally, I never make it up 100.  When the game was over, I was only behind J by a few points.  Normally, he beats my pants off in bowling.</p><p>After the game, it had been a good hour since I had taken the material, and I was just now starting to peak.  Neither of us wanted to go home, and I was not in any condition to continue bowling, so J offered to drive us to Cheyenne, Wyoming since I had not been there before, and it was only an hour or so away.  I smoked a quick bowl before we left the parking lot.  As soon as we hit the highway, I turned on the radio and then the joy really began.</p><p>I am not much of a 70s classic rock fan.  However, the song that played next was Dust in the Wind by Kansas, and it could not have been more perfect.  As soon as the first few notes hit, I felt such a profound sense of elation and warmth that I almost did not know what to do with it all.</p><p>I close my eyes only for a moment, then the moments gone.</p><p>I closed my eyes and instantly went out of my body, left behind all sense of time, and became one with the music.  Every beautiful note filled me with chills of joy.  I was in utter ecstasy, a brief moment of the rapturea plus-four.  Out of my body I went, and into this universe of color and form and joy.  This really took me by surprise, as I had no idea a hedonistic experience (I like to call trips-for-pleasure, hedonistic) would lead to that moment of oneness with everything.  I felt blessed, and tears came to my eyes.</p><p>As J was no stranger to the psychedelic experience, he could tell by my smile what was happening.  He was considerate enough to leave me alone until I spoke to him, not wanting to interfere in my experience.  I was very grateful for that.  When the song was over, I opened my eyes and just said, Thank you.  I was not thanking anyone in particular, rather I was thanking everything (God, J, Kansas, myself) for giving me that couple of minutes of bliss.</p><p>When we arrived in Cheyenne, two hours had passed and the N,N-DPT was rapidly wearing off.  We drove around the empty streets of Cheyenne for an hour or so, and then made our way back to home.  The drive back was very relaxing, and we had some nice, deep conversations.  There was quite a bit of warmth and empathy, much like coming off of MDMA.  By the three hour point, I was almost completely down when we arrived back home.  I took a shower, and sleep came easily.</p><p>Epilogue:</p><p>Looking back, I must say that N,N-DPT is a funny material.  I tend to associate it with tension, anxiety, and fear because of my first few experiences with it.  But that trip showed me another side of N,N-DPT that I sadly do not reference often when thinking of the drug, nor do I experience it often when taking the drug.  I hope future exposures once again return me to the bliss I felt.</p><p>I wanted to share this report to show that even the most serious of psychedelics (I consider N,N-DPT one serious material) can occasionally be used for recreational purposes.  However, I want to make it clear that I am not recommending anyone use N,N-DPT for such purposes.  Three of the most difficult psychedelic experiences I have had were a result of ingesting this drug.</p><p>In retrospect, I am pretty amazed that I experienced such a blissful state from a drug that I tend to fear.  This is especially out of the ordinary considering I took it and went bowling.  If someone told me that a bowling alley was where they wanted to take N,N-DPT, I would dissuade them from doing so.  But of course, everyone must make their own decisions in the end.</p>"
