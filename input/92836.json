 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI have experienced with some serious drugs before, including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, morphine, even less potent synthetic cannabinoid products, and never had I experienced anything like this, to my surprise, because I thought all fake bud products were generally the same. I had quite a tolerance to the lesser synthetic products, so I guess I thought I could handle this no problem.\r\nI had already been put on probation for a drug-related offense at school at only 16 (quiet sad I know), for purchasing a pill of suboxone at school. Yes, I had learned my lesson, blah blah, no more pills for me. And to this day this is true. But obviously, being on probation because of drugs, of course my PO was going to be giving me random drug tests, which meant no pot for me, which beforehand, I was quite a regular. I had actually smoked one day after my community service work with some of my buddies I had met working there, and I suggested we get legal bud, and we did. It was hardly anything, as I smoked almost the entire blunt and didnt feel much. Thinking that this was the original three-star (there are several potencies of Down to Earth, starting with one-star being the lightest, [although this potency is stronger for me than the three-star] all the way up to a [rumored] seven-star, which I have never experienced or heard of anyone experiencing), I thought I was fine with it, almost invincible. How wrong I was.\r\nI went to my friends house, and we decided to smoke that night. She also smoked this legal pot, being as her mother is strict, and she doesnt want to show up positive on a traditional drug test. I had smoked with her probably a week before of this legal marijuana, although it was a different kind, called Stuk, which I had never heard of. It was quite powerful, and definitely did make me feel stuck. It was especially powerful for her, because by the end of the night she was throwing it up, and acting extremely strange, twitching and looking about ready to pass out. She had smoked this before though, and was fine the first time, which just goes to show how unpredictable this stuff is. \r\nAnyway, her brother was the owner of this stuff, being as you had to be 18 or older to legally possess it. (Even though it doesnt matter now, because its just as illegal as any other illegal drug.) He was smoking it and was fine, I guess because he had a much higher tolerance than me or my friend. He showed me the packet, which I couldnt identify seeing it before, just knowing it was the fake shit. I couldnt tell what it was called either, because the top had already been ripped off to open it. He didnt dare let my friend smoke any of it, because of her last experience about a week earlier. He handed me the bowl, which was only about half full, which I thought was a bunch of crap, thinking it would do nothing. I lit up, took a huge ass hit, held it for a while, and exhaled. My friends brother told me to wait a minute, to see how I felt, but I felt nothing but a slight looseness in the bending of my arms, which was hardly paralyzing. So I decided to take another huge ass hit and finish the bowl off. What a mistake.\r\nI remember sitting on the futon next to my friend, who was about a foot apart from me. A movie was playing, and we were sitting in the dark basement. I remember trying to watch the screen, but couldnt, because everything was too funny. My friend looked at me, and I looked at her, and just started laughing uncontrollably. I couldnt stop, even if I tried. She started laughing at me, which made me laugh even harder, and I tried to stop laughing but just couldnt, so I just gave up. That lasted for about 20  30 seconds, and I closed my eyes and put my hands over my face to try to calm myself. I closed my eyes, and thats when it all started. Describing the feeling is quite impossible, but never had I felt anything so intense, not even on acid. I had never experienced anything that came on so strong. It just hit me. It felt like being at a car flying forward at 60 miles an hour, and then suddenly stopping and flying in reverse at 80 miles an hour. At this point I knew I was tripping, hard.\r\nIt was a difficult experience to say the least. I remember seeing little things, I dont even remember what, just weird little stupid things, but like it was a film with different frames. There would be a new frame every second, and it would change by means of what looked like a strobe light. I couldnt feel anything, or even tell if my eyes were opened or closed. This whole experience was just very dreamlike. I remember trying to wake up, but couldnt. I just waited, calmed down, and thought I would wake up at any second. How wrong I was.\r\nThe thought occurred to me that I would be like this forever. That everything would look animated. That I would be retarded for life. That I would need to be in a wheelchair because I couldnt even walk. I thought of my mom and how sad and disappointed and angry she would be at me, that her eldest, most intelligent daughter would end up fucked up for life. Then I thought about my dad, who really doesnt give a shit about me. I could hear him saying I told you this would happen! Just like he did when I got caught at school with the suboxone. I was so disappointed in myself, so I just tried as hard as I could to wake up, but I still couldnt. This was probably around the point that I started freaking out.\r\nIt seemed like years that this went on, but in reality it was probably only 10, 20 minutes. I remember thinking of the word crying, just the word itself, and then it happened. I felt myself crying. Tears were running down my face, even though I wasnt sad. I remember still being able to hear my friend and her brother, and he asked is she crying? and she replied with yes, and started laughing, which I must admit I probably would have done too.\r\nI remember thinking the words I cant do this as I was trying to wake up. I guess I was saying this out loud, because apparently I kept repeating this for a good few minutes. My friends brother had come over to the other side of me from where he was before, because obviously things were not okay. Their other brother, at some point, I was told, had opened the basement door at the top of the stairs and called down to ask them something. My friend told me she had to cover my mouth to make sure their brother didnt come down, for he would have told their mother that I was having a seizure or something, which we definitely did not want.\r\nMy friend told me I was rocking  back and forth, and at one point I remember hearing myself say Oh my god over and over, while kicking my legs continuously, STILL trying to gain consciousness. It probably didnt happen for another 5 or 10 minutes, and I remember opening my eyes and finally exhaling and breathing out holy shit. Her brother finally asked, Are you okay? And I replied yes, and I just sat there and stopped kicking and tried to look around without falling into that parallel dimension. Someone told me to try to watch the TV, but it was so bright, and I was too scared to start geeking out again, so I just stared at the wall. \r\nThis feeling wasnt completely gone however, I remember falling back into a tired state after trying to focus on something, and I felt as if I could see the words I was saying. I wasnt speaking with English letters, but with my own letters and words. I wondered if they could understand what I was saying, because I thought that I was speaking in a different language, like I had invented speaking itself. I spoke in syllables, as if I was stuttering. I remember looking at things and feeling as if I could see the energy around everything, and not the objects themselves. My friend just laughed at me when I spoke of this. I eventually got around to watching the movie that was on, and feeling as though I was asleep, and everything started changing and looking different. Then I would wake up from this, and realize this was reality, and that this pattern would keep going on for a while until I was completely sober. \r\nI was pretty well sobered up, just exhausted, and I decided to lie down on the futon. I dont know how long I slept for or how long it took for me to fall asleep, but I just passed out. I remember waking up later, when they were still awake, and they wanted to go out to smoke a cigarette. They asked if I could walk, and I said yes, which I could. I felt completely normal now, as if I just had woken up from a horrible, horrible nightmare. My friend told me what I looked like from her perspective, and I just couldnt believe any of it had happened. I was surprised I hadnt pissed or shat myself, and very grateful that I hadnt. \r\nI had gone over to the same friends house about a day or two later, and was informed that the stuff I had geeked out on was Down to Earth Climaxxx, three-star. The Down to Earth I had smoked before was not nearly as strong, and in a completely different packaging. But that day I smoked the same stuff again, with a lot more smaller hits, and was completely fine, just totally stoned. I still had the strobe light affect, and I had to keep reminding myself that this was reality, not a dream. I twitched a little, and laughed a lot as well. Its just amazing how unpredictable this shit really is, and extremely dangerous. It has already been made illegal in the same year that I had experienced this, about a month later. \r\nAll in all, it was the worst trip I have ever had, and this is not something to be messed with. However, I would (and have) smoked it times after, and was fine. The trick is to take steady, small hits, and wait a good amount of time to ensure that you wont take too many hits, and end up freaking out like I did.\n\n\n"
