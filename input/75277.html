I decided to revisit the world of the other.<br><br>
My journey began at 12pm Monday 24th of November 2008<br><br>
Before my journey I ate only my normal veggie food. No yeast or aged cheese was consumed.<br><br>
I ingested 3g of Syrian Rue Powder in 6 veggie caps . Consuming 2 capsules every 10 minutes . I then consumed 6.2g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powdered in veggie caps.Consuming 2 capsules every 10 minutes.The first two of these I consumed with the last two Syrian Rue Capsules. I then consumed 8.0g of Mimosa Hostilis powdered bark in 20 veggie caps &amp; 4.2g of Acacia Catechu bark powdered in to 7 veggie capsules .<br><br>
The first two Mimosa Hostilis capsules were taken with the last two Psilocybe Semilanceata capsules. The rest were consumed 2 capsules every 10 minutes.Thus from midnight until 6am all capsules were consumed. A snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) &amp; 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) 250mg was included in the mimosa hostilis as was an extra 2.0g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powder.All capsules were taken orally with a small amount of pure water and some organic clover honey.<br>
I consumed 3 organic unsalted Scottish Oatcakes .Washed down with half a pint of water. I also consumed 1 teaspoon of Organic Clover Honey approximately every hour from 2 am until 6am.<br><br>
There was no Nausea. There was no Purging , no diarrhoea  .<br><br>
I had to endure a very difficult task.This was very very difficult but the reward was a blessing of the most lovely kind.<br><br>
Experiences.<br><br>
I was transferred from my bedroom to literally another dimension. This dimension was death.<br>
I was dead. I was really truly dead. I was fully conscious not breathing . no one was there. My hell was my room and my house which I was never to leave. There were no people no ghosts , no spirits , no animals  , no aliens nothing but me. I could shout and scream or talk calmly. But no one was there there was no answer. No friends no loved ones ,no one at all except me &amp; Death. This vile slime , this vile filth , this vile crud was all &amp; everything that has ever been wrong . It was cruel , absurd , insane , demonic , twisted , noisy, dirty , messy , unloved , rattling , banging , screeching , shuddering , despicable , demented , unknown , fictitious , controlling , tyrannical , bullying , violent, murderous , trapped , torturous &amp; unspeakably wrong.I had to do battle with this moronic unfeeling nightmare of death, perversion , ignorance , selfishness encased in wilful depravity. I fought all night until I collapsed naked on my sofa down stairs. This was not in my head . I found my house stained with slime and dust &amp; cruddy specks of filth . There were drinks up the walls on the floors stained. But these stains were covered in cobwebs and the accumulation of toxic dusts , molds &amp; mucous. There were bits of paper fluff receipts junk old faded plastic bags bottles caps and other buried junk from  the earth .This was not my home or my house or my street or my dimension. I walked like and old man shuffling side to side not forward or backwards.This hellish dimension of death was utterly cold. Inane ,vacuous , vacant laghter came from the walls the bed the house the doors banging crashing scratching at my soul. I was in a battle for my soul , sanity and mind.<br><br>
One on One with death.<br><br>
I could hear the clock ticking ticking ticking so loud. Yet I have no clock in my room.My watch had stopped at about 4am The hands of the watch moved backwards and forwards and sometimes it did not move. This was for many many many hours. I began to panic I suddenly realised I was indeed dead . Totally dead. There was no escape. I was destined to go up &amp; down the stairs looking for any one or any thing that could help me hundreds of times.I was lost and resigned to this prison. I thought to my self this is it I have really done this time I have o.d.'d .I could not leave my house. Things did not work as they should sounds were slowed and very fast and grimacing gurning hideous facial expressions were occurring every moment on my face. Strange noises and demented childish noises of toilet functions, burps , farts, gutters ,ringing ,clanging, sewage flushes, retches and noises of the most indescribable patheticness....these obtrusive desperate attacks on me worked . I was thrashing around at the speed of light so fast like a strobe I rolled &amp; twitched entangled in bedding and clothing . Caught up in a mangle of tangle.I was gone dead suffocated strangled by invisible hands as my mind was ripped from my corpse and taken in the the depths of insanity.The room was chaos . Books would turn over automatically. The watch was frozen at 5am. I was in Hell my own hell my lonely worthless pathetic gruesome Hell.Ten billion words a second flashing through my head every voice of every evil wretch &amp; every damned barbaric demon .They laughed and assaulted me in every way ripping me apart and reconstituting me again only to be ripped apart again and again.<br><br>
Victory.<br><br>
So how you may ask am I able to wright this account . How did I recover &amp; revive myself from absolute death ?<br><br><br>
Simple I owe my life to one man. David Icke.<br><br>
Yes David Icke.<br><br>
Out of the corner of my eye whilst thrashing in my wrestle with death I saw David Ickes book.<br><br>
Tales from the time loop.<br><br>
Tales from the time loop.....instantly I saw a way out of this. Death ? There is no Death.<br>
Infinite love is the only reality everything else is illusion. I fought my mind back from the abyss by repeating &amp; repeating this mantra over &amp; over....again...and again....thank you David Icke. I laughed for joy as I realised that I was stuck in this tale from the time loop.<br><br>
I love my family I said I love my family I love David Icke I love goodness love peace &amp; wisdom. I love God.I repeated this many many times.....<br><br>
Gradually the twitching subsided the voices became more and more infantile pathetic broken into whispers.<br><br>
I worked it all out in an epiphany of pure joy &amp; bliss.<br><br>
I was dead in the Matrix. Yet I knew now it was a Time loop. The watch was still stuck at 5am &amp; I was stuck in a loop... Death...Meets...Time....D.M.T. ....loop.<br><br>
I was overcome at the Genius of Infinite Oneness Infinite possibility. David Icke...David Icke.<br><br>
Da Vid I c 'k ...e.....Tales from the Time Loop.<br><br>
I knew then that this name was my ticket out of death.<br><br>
Da  = The<br>
Vid = Video<br>
I   = I<br>
c   = See <br>
k   = OK<br>
e   = E..EEE... E.. is for Ecstasy Loved up... Love... Love...Love<br><br>
Infinite Love is the only REALITY ...Everything else is ILLUSION ... I can not Die I am not Dead. Death is Illusion. I was in a loop !!!<br><br>
A Loop... and a Tale is a story , a fabrication , a fiction ....an Illusion.<br><br>
I had seen a video of David Icke at Brixton Academy. Where he explained the whole illusion Game plan.<br><br>
That was it I immediately noticed a massive subsidence from the Death Beast. Whimpering and scurrying away like slime down a mouldy wall. The twitching lessened over the next hours or so ass the watch hands started moving again slowly at first but gaining pace until normality arrived and I exhausted collapsed in total comfort and without moving I slept deeply and awakened at 8am totally refreshed totally awake . Not tired in any way. I saw Blue sky and heard the birds &amp; the people getting off to work.This dimension is not the same as my last  dimension. I am the Time Traveller . The Soul Traveller. I am alive in body and in soul.I am inter dimensional infinite love I am not the illusion I have beaten the illusion. I am free. I have liberated my family. I sacrificed my life to beat Death ....and I did beat death. Now I know we are safe. I am not afraid of death. Death is a wimp.<br><br>
My family arrived and they were a bit flustered and dusty and the house looked like it had been frozen in time dust and clutter was everywhere. Not at all the same house I came from.I travelled through space time. This was my destination my HEAVEN. My lovely family my lovely friends my new Brother David Icke. There was a new feeling to this place everyone was smiling and happy. The birds were happy .I was happy ecstatic . I hugged my mum &amp; Dad and brother .Something I have rarely if ever done before. I immediately &amp; without question decided to fix everything that was wrong in my life. I scrubbed the House polished the house and spent all day removing stains and doing favours for friends and family which again is something I am not often asked to do . And in truth I have rarely offered to do. Now all I can think of is helping everyone. Talking to everyone and making a plan to shake Mr. Ickes Hand.<br><br>
He has told the truth and Infinite possibility a.k.a. God has shown me this.<br><br>
This is why David Icke is my hero and I want him to know that he will be cured &amp; is now being cured of his Arthritic condition. This is a gift from me to him. And when I shake his hand his pain will disappear.<br><br>
Conclusion.<br><br>
Death is not linear . We do not age in linear fashion.<br>
Death is not in front of us . Nor is it behind us. It is not above us neither is it below us.When you move forward you end up back at the beginning .Life is a loop a Moebius.<br><br>
So where is death ?<br>
It is one step away to the left. The dimension of the left is Death. The Dimension of the right is life.<!-- End Body -->
