I had been waiting for Australia day restlessly for many days before it came around. The previous 4 days had been reasonably boring and uneventful and I was confident Australia day would be a nice distraction before my senior high school year. A bit over a week before Aus day 2 of my friends, let's call them T and W had decided we would split a half oz. 3 ways. All the arrangements were made and myself and W had both given our money to T whom usually got our higher amounts of weed through his brother.<br><br>
Everything was going textbook until Wednesday when I received a surprise call from T in the late afternoon. T informed me that getting the half oz. was proving almost impossible and asked me if we wanted to drop pills instead. I hesitated, I had been doing pills almost every weekend and thought I should slow down. T said he would ring W and get his opinion in the matter, us being all in this together I agreed. T rang back soon after and said that W had agreed to drop and I said I would as well then. So, Thursday soon comes around, the 3 of us had all been going to go to a friends house for an afternoon of drinking and mindless screwing around. Through the day I consumed 6 or 7 beers and by the time we were about to go down to the swan river bay to watch the fireworks at 8:00 I was feeling a little under the weather.<br><br>
Not wanting my unsettled stomach to affect the E, I drank a powdered equivalent of alka seltsa (I forget its actual name) mixed in a cup of water. While this did settle my stomach it did make me pretty gassy much to the chagrin of my Friends. We began to walk down to the bay around 5:30, It was a fair long walk, maybe a kilometre or so. This walk gave us time to get our thoughts together and try to get the three of us all on the same mental level. This would be the first time I rolled with W who is a good friend of mine. I had rolled with T twice before. We made it down to the bay forshore around 6:00, this gave us a chance to meet T brother who had our pills. We meet him around 6:20, got our pills, and proceeded to consume them around 6:30. When I went to eat mine, I noticed the terrible chemical, anniseed taste. It was truly horrible but supposedly this was the sign of a good clean MDMA pill. <br><br>
We hacked around the bay for a good 30 mintues and saw some friends from school, most were blind drunk or very tipsy. the Bay was crowded, I wasn't sure this was good or bad for the roll but I decided to just wait and see, This played a pretty interesting part in my roll which was soon to come. 15 minutes past from 7:00. Me, T and W were all talking to some friends, I went to turn around and noticed something, the world was bright, sharp and interesting. It was like a veil had been lifted off my vision and my eyes sucked in more information. I said nothing to T or W. We sat down at the base of a tree. I was coming up, hard. I tryed to keep my mind off it and not over analyze it like I had times previous times. We talked about the day and especially how good we thought the fireworks would be. My thoughts flowed quicker and easier. I felt I had a valid opinion to any topic. I was closer to T and W than ever before, I saw them truly as friends. People I could act like myself around. It was a comforting feeling and I felt at home in this group.<br><br>
The E kept coming, This was truly a clean pill. Very gradual indeed. It was at this time things got a little intense. It was 7:30 and I needed space, badly. The noise from all around me felt like a thick sea I couldn't escape and I was drowning in It. Momentarily I felt like they were all about to turn on me. I felt like the whole bay and forshore would drop what they were doing and rush and attack me. Logic and reason took me by the shoulders and shook me. That would never happen I said to myself, but still, the crowd was overpowering and I needed fresh air and some space. I told T of my circumstance and he said to follow him. We went away from the bay and across the street and into the university. We sat against a building and I told T what I felt. He understood and said that when I felt ready to, we should go find W who we had lost a few minutes earlier.<br><br>
We got back to the Bay and found W almost immediately. He said he wasn't feeling anything yet but T was feeling the first effects. I on the other hand had been thrown into a full roll with no sight of it stopping. The uneasyness had ceased and I was very, very happy. As the 3 of us walked around, A huge grin was plasted on my face, I was floating above the ground in complete warm euphoria. As we looked for a spot to watch the fireworks from, I noticed that the police base station was surrounded by a blue canvas type fabric. By this time it was dark and a very bright flood light had illuminated this blue canvas stuff from the inside of the compound, it looked amazing at least. It glowed like a magical force field around this installation of which I couldn't enter. I commented this to T and W, both agreed it was quite trippy. As we went past I dragged my finger tips across the surface and felt its interesting texture. It was rough and almost alien.<br><br>
As we sat at our chosen vantage spot, it was apparant that T and W were both E-ing like a mother fucker. The first fireworks began at 8:00 and we all settled into the show.  A few weeks early I recalled T commenting about a experience he had read about a guy who took a pill then went rock climbing. As the MDMA took hold he looked over to a mountain in the distance and could not look at it, its beauty blinding him. The Fireworks were just that. I was truly not worthy of this sight. The explosions of colour in the open sky, I wanted to look away but I couldn't. These simple pyrotechnics grabed me. My stomach and chest tensed with patriotic pride as we celebrated this wonderful nation.<br><br>
T said nothing the whole time. I don't think he even blinked the whole 30 minutes. Half way through W leaned over and said that he thought he should tell his parents he loved them more. I put my hand on his shoulder and said what a good thing that was and how he should go with it. The fireworks ended with a great grand finale. The crowd cheered and I felt complete. The E began to come down, probably with the thought that we would have to go home and face our parents soon. It was a pleasant feeling and like I said before it felt like there a missing chunk of my being that was replaced.<br><br>
We got up to find the group we had come down with and found them quickly. We asked what we should do next and after some debate we decided to go back to the friends house we were at before. I began to get tense again, I felt surrounded by a drunked orgy of violence and blind patriotism. I was happy again when we started moving. We began walking back at around 9:00 and I was already feeling very tired  a mere 100 metres into our journey. I began to think about how alcohol was legal just because it was a good taxable drug, while something like MDMA, something so profoundly good and life changing was illegal just because there was a few 'ifs' and 'buts' about its effect on the human body. Alcohol creates so many problems in society, family breakups, crime and anger, death and heartbreak I thought. While E opens up your soul and lets you see the world from such a positive angle, I found this hard to accept. Looking over, I felt profoundly closer to T and W, we shared a group hug which I enjoyed. I was happy to see them as content as I was too.<br><br>
We got back to our friends house at around 10:00 and all I could think of was a drink. I got picked up from his place at around 10:10 and went home completely drained. I had a shower which was almost orgasmic, I was still rolling when I got home but my hopeless tiredness took over and I retired to bed. My thoughts bouncing of the experiences of the day before falling silent as I drifted into sleep. <br><br>
I awoke the next day happier than usual. Its a bright sunny summer day I thought, I felt It held limitless potential and value. I met T and W at our friends house were we helped clean up. We filled an entire wheelie bin with cans and bottles and pronounced His Australia day party a resounding success. We went to have a cone in the park and after a few set backs, A lost lighter, our preferred spot being taken and some run ins from some less than liked classmates I enjoyed a fat waterfall hit. We sat around on a park bench for a while, absorbing nature. We got back on our bikes to ride around the park after about 15 minutes of sitting. That was a very good bike ride indeed. I was truly free letting the breeze blow through me. I laughed like a maniac and sighed with content. Well, that was my Australia day for 2006.<!-- End Body -->
