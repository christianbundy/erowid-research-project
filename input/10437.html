Slipping through the Coil of Space and Time<br>
*The Holy Trinity: Psilocybin, Harmine, DimethylTrypamine*<br>
By DMT 333 (-Fu- 11/6/01)<br><br>
After completing another successful extraction of N,N DimethylTryptamine Freebase from mimosa rootbark, I was again ready to experiment with a synergistic combination I have dubbed 'The Holy Trinity'.  This combination consists of 60 grams of fresh Psilocybe Cubensis (with veils still intact); 1 gram of Harmala alkaloid extract (equivalent to 4g Syrian Rue seeds), and to top it all off 60 milligrams of DMT freebase.<br><br>
Keep in mind that the Harmala alkaloids are Mono Amino Oxidase Inhibitors which causes these alkaloids to inhibit the production of the MAO enzyme which breaks down serotonin as well as other tryptamines i.e. DMT/Psilocybin therefore potentiating the effects achieved by the psychoactive tryptamines ingested.<br><br>
Having fasted for 8 hours, at 5:55 PM I ingested 1 gram of Harmala Extract in a 'OOO' sized gelcap; promptly following at 6:36 PM I thoroughly chewed and ingested the 60 grams of mushrooms and chased it down with a small glass of freshly squeezed orange juice with lime.<br><br>
Immediately after consumption of the fungi I felt a distinct hazy-dreamlike attribute to my environment, something I always noticed upon the onset of an MAOI + DMT/Psilocybin journey.  From 7:00-7:45 I began to progressively watch my ego disintegrate itself into the aethyr.  This process of ego dissolution started out as a delicate web-like structure that appeared to be made of silver illuminating threads of silk emmanating from the center of my field of vision.  This web continued to increase in detail and otherworldiness as multi-colored translucent tentacles began to spiral around each silver thread of this 'web'.  <br><br>
As this web-like structure continued to become more intricate I could feel my ego being overshadowed by what I can only describe as an unstoppable mechanistic, emotionally void state of consciousness; in addition there is a crackling noise that progressively emcompasses your awareness as this state of consciousness unfolds in your mind - it is quite similar to tinnitus (musician's curse).  I have come to refer to this state of consciousness that develops as 'mycelial consiousness' or 'plant consciousness', others I know refer to it as 'insectoid' or even 'extraterrestrial' awareness. (Or hell you can even call it the 'void') It soon appeared as if I penetrated as what I can only describe as a membrane or bubble, for when that happened this web-like structure became very animated.  <br><br>
I lost all my bearings; I knew I was once again in that familiar place known as hyperspace but I forgot who I was and how I got there.  I was in absolutely awe as this 'web' morphed into what appeared as a plasma octopoid with flailing appendages similar to tentacles that were moving VERY fast and appeared to be tending to some task quite dilligently.  In addition when these tentacles would move they would emit a reverberating set of tones each movement produced a unique set of harmonic audio expressions.  Soon I became aware that this 'octopoid' was actually redirecting my awareness to these *incredible* structures that were made with his appendages/harmonic manipulations.<br><br>
Each time my attention would come to rest I would suddenly feel my awareness redirected to another structure being built that was more spectacular than the last.  Before long I noticed a pressure in my center and I realized once again I was contained in a physical vehicle and that I was perceiving the weight of my hands interlaced on my solar plexus.  My ego was reassembling itself and the web/octopoid simultaneously was losing it's animate life-like qualities.<br><br>
I looked at the clock, it read 7:38 PM, 'perfect!', I thought to myself, 'Now's the time to load up on DMT while the MAOI is still coursing through my veins.'  Immediately I retrieved my DMT pipe along with the premeasured dose of 60 mg I had weighed out.  I started playing a CD of a Japanese Shakuhama Flute player and sat in full lotus position with the DMT pipe pressed up against my 3rd eye contemplating the journey about to take place and what I wanted to gain from it.<br><br>
As the music in the background began to play I began to torch the bottom of my glass DMT oil pipe and watched as the DMT Crystals first liquified then vaporized into the chamber of the pipe.  I took 4 huge lungfuls and as I exhaled the fourth lungful of smoke I was washed away into hyperspace once again.  Upon entering hyperspace I percieved myself falling through a tunnel in zero gravity at light speed then once again I penetrated a 'bubble/membrane' and was in what I refer to as 'The Dome' or 'The Control Panel' only this time instead of a percieved 'octopoid' redirecting my awareness to various structures there was this huge gelatinous-hexagonal-rubix-cube type machine that would reform itself into structures according to these progressive harmonic tones that permeated my reality causing various emotions to emerge in addition it was redirecting my attention to various intersections of it's restructured embodiment. <br><br>
Each time my attention was pointed to one of these intersections/nodes a vision followed by a revelation, would envelope me along with an emotion I can only describe as pure elation and awe.  The only vision/relevation that I vividly remember was one of humanity's history.  I recall seeing many people in positions of power from ancient civilizations from all around the globe.  I could see a distinct spectrum of colors for each spirit that belonged to each of these kings/warriors/ thieves/martyrs/prophets and shamans.<br><br>
I saw their entire lifespan from birth to death and then saw how each of these kings/warriors etc. subconsiously chose the exact moment they were going to die as well as how they died and as result of their choices their spirits were reborn into the bodies of the leaders/warriors/shamans of the next generation in order to continue their spiritual development were it left off in addition to being catalysts for events of novelty that were yet to unfold (ie some warriors reborn as leaders etc).  This process of reincarnation continued generation after generation up until the present day.<br><br>
As I was coming out of hyperspace I realized I was emitting these very strange noises from my mouth that were actually driving and changing the visual content of my experience, what struck me as even more strange/amazing was that in addition to every noticeable change in the visual content of my trip and vocal emissions coincided wih changes in my physical environment such as windblowing/crickets chirping.  Feeling like a newborn baby fresh from the womb I shed a tear in absolute reverence for life and being.<br><br>
Note:  Do not assume because of the way much of this was presented that I believe in mushroom entities or DMT entities... I do not come to such premature conclusions without proper empirical evidence.  For me, everything is one spirit.  One Life, One Love.<br><br>
May all of your experiences be fruitful -Fu-<!-- End Body -->
