 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction<br>Well Id previously tried San Pedro cactus with little effect (probably due to my drying in the oven method) so I decided Id give mescaline one last try before giving up. I had pretty much decided I was just unlucky and it wasnt going to work for me, but thought Id give it one last chance. <br>Preparation<br>I had ordered a cutting from a reputable online seller and was surprised and happy to find a nice package waiting for me when I got home on a Friday afternoon, after having worked eight days straight. I decided to at least prepare the cactus for consumption even if I didnt actually eat it that day, so I spent the next two or so hours de-spinning and removing the skin of it (which is a bastard of a job to do). I was left with a good amount of dark greenish flesh.<br>Consumption - 5:00 pm<br>I cut the flesh I had into strips of about 4 - 5 cm in length, and proceeded to eat one strip every couple of minutes for about half an hour to 45 minutes. The only beverage I had was water unfortunately, though I found the most easiest way to eat the cactus was to put each strip in my mouth, then fill with water and swallow it down whole. A few times I gagged, from the legendary strong bitter and slimy cactus taste, but managed to get pretty much all of my Pedro eaten.<br>The Experience<br>6:00 pm: My flatmate T had previously asked me if I wanted to come to dinner with him and a few of his workmates at a strip club. I decided, what the hell, might as well (Id never been to a strip club before) so I got ready, ate a couple of No-Doz tablets to give me some energy and we left. <br>6:45 pm: The bus drops us off in the city and we walk a few blocks to the club. By this time the No-Doz is working its magic and I feel pretty energetic, while at the same time noticing something slightly odd, I could feel the beginnings of a trip - which was unexpected. I really didnt think it would work at all. By the time we got to the strip club I was feeling rather odd, but we met T's workmates there and sat down for our meal. I decided I didn't want a meal as my stomach wasn't feeling that great, so I said I'd eat T's entrée instead. I found I could only get through about half the entrée mainly because I was feeling slightly nauseous from the cactus (though really not too bad) and also because for just some reason I didnt feel like eating at all.<br>8:00 pm: By now I was pretty screwed, the mescaline was taking hold and I was starting to get some odd effects. A strip club is a surreal place to be when on mescaline, there were women walking around completely naked, standing at the bar or sitting at tables with rich old men. I was somewhat reminded of the scene in Fear and Loathing where they are at the bar, just before he sees the people turn into the reptiles. I wasnt completely sure what was going on and seemed to be overcome by waves of happy confusion. I would liken it to a mixture of a very low dose of E and quite a bit of alcohol, at least thats how it felt at that point - another similarity to E was the niceness felt when someone hugged me slightly. There appeared to be fine lines around everything, similar to fingerprints but surrounding and encompassing everyday objects. I would look at T and watch the lines around his eyes and face - they appeared to be moving a little as well.<br>9:00 pm: When the floor show started I was less interested in the naked and semi naked women than at the visual effects I was getting. One of the strippers danced her way onto our table and started to gyrate and move right in front of me - inches from my face. I was still in a state of confusion and found her pretty amusing but I really just wasnt interested - instead staring at the flashing lights of the club that would flash, then seem to take forever to fade out slowly. One of the strippers went behind a curtain type thing to do one of those shadow shows, and as she danced behind it I watched with amazement the trails her shadow was leaving as it moved. <br>10:30 pm: At this point I am acting and feeling quite drunk though I havent touched a drop. I look around at the pictures of naked women on the walls and they look like they are moving. A strange decorative object on the wall catches my eye, it is like a sort of a sun with a spiral pattern in the middle of it, surrounded by squiggly triangles pointing outwards. I decided I really couldnt look at this object as the spiral seemed to be moving, as well as the squiggly triangles - it was hypnotic. I am drawn back to this object many times as the night progresses. <br>11:30 pm: I am still screwed and the drug doesnt appear to be wearing off as yet. I stare at my arms and hands and they appear misshapen, my right arm in particular seems quite a lot longer than my left arm, which appears deformed. My hand grows and contracts, my fingers are fatter then thinner. I decide I should probably stop looking at my body parts before everyone thinks Im insane. <br>12:30 pm: The nausea or heavy feeling in my stomach is a bit stronger now, I suppose I wouldnt class it as nausea more as just a heavy slightly sick feeling - kind of like when youve drunk too much beer. Im still seeing some pretty odd stuff, the visual effects are quite strong still but my energy has dissipated. By about 1 am we decide to catch a taxi, as there is no one else we know out and Im not really in the mood for partying anymore.<br>I knew getting to sleep wouldnt be easy, Ive had trouble on E before and I would class this as pretty much the same difficulty, plus my stomach wasnt feeling very good, and it was made all the more noticeable by lying down in the dark. Fortunately I had some interesting visuals to look at, like the previously mentioned lines in the air, as well as diamond and series of dot shapes moving around in the dark. I did see some other weird patterns and shapes in the dark of my room, but I couldnt explain them to you unless youve seen something similar yourself. I tried to sleep for about half an hour, but realised this was just not going to work so I grabbed my MP3 player and put on some Simon and Garfunkel, which made me feel instantly better. After that was finished I was feeling slightly better, though I also felt like listening to a particular few songs, one in particular Where is my Mind (you know the one, its at the end of Fight Club) which was incredibly trippy to listen to. Id never really listened to the lyrics before but my god they are weird to hear on mescaline, especially when hes singing about swimming in the Caribbean.<br>The song finished and I finally felt like sleeping. When I woke up in the morning there was still some slight after effects on my vision, the fuzz or what I like to call static I normally see over everything was slightly more pronounced. My stomach felt fine.<br>Conclusion<br>All in all a very rewarding and interesting experience. I would have liked to have maybe gone around to a few places or even go for a walk in nature rather than sit in a strip club the entire time, though that was fun also. The nausea was not really too much of an issue, even though it did get a bit worse later on its nothing compared to HBW seeds.\n\n\n"
