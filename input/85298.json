 "report": "<p>I have tried and enjoyed (usually!) taking substances on an occasional basis.  However, when hearing about mephedrone and that it was easily available, cheap and legal, I quickly became addicted!  Luckily for me and probably many others, it was made illegal, shortly after I bought my first batch! But knowing it was going to be made illegal, I decided to stock up and purchased 20 grammes.  I have this morning thrown about 12 grammes of it down the toilet and decided not to ever buy any 'legal' drugs again!  </p><p>Why??  </p><p>Well, the drug for me was wonderful whilst I was taking it, felt relaxed, euphoric at times, confident etc etc..... but the next day felt awful for most of the day, with a vacant feeling, loss of memory, depression at times, dizzy, headache, tired, aching limbs, chest pains, and many more other undesirable effects!  I also realised that due to the lack of sleep etc, over the last 6 weeks or so, I was beginning to lose my good looks.  I was not motivated to do anything any more, which is very unlike me as I was always up and about! I even lost interest in the things I really enjoyed before! </p><p>So, have decided that enough is enough and I wont be doing this ever again!</p>"
