I had off from work on Thursday and I figured it would be a perfect time to conduct a little experiment with a new chemical, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(i)-propylthiophenethylamine (2C-T-4, PIHKAL #41).  After my partner and our other roommates left for work, I placed a small eyeballed (see disclaimer below) amount of this substance, estimated to be between 5-10 mg, into a 1 ml vial of scotch to be divided into a couple small gelcaps.  These gelcaps were then consumed orally over a period of 30 minutes between 8:30 am  9:00 am with a big glass of water to space out the dosing without tasting the chemical.<br><br>
At around 9:45 am, I began to get my first alert.  This brief glimmer was experienced along with a slight anxiety that often accompanies the beginning of such an experiment.  I decided to augment a little bit of hash to the mix to get past this not quite there feeling and then I found myself nicely stoned and even a little tired, still at a plus 1.  I made a cup of coffee and some soup for myself, went into the living room and turned on the TV and watched a really stupid action movie that I usually would not be watching, but I found myself hopelessly engrossed in it.<br><br>
By 11:00 am, something was definitely developing but I could quite place it even though it was a solid +2.  I abandoned the TV and brought in the mail, which included a letter from my father.  Reading this letter was incredibly emotional for me, but in a good way.  Id rather not go into the details in this report, but only to say that my threshold for being moved emotionally was greatly lower than it usually is.  I went into my room to find a list of things I wanted to accomplish on my day off, including the normal household chores as well as other projects.  I decided to throw out the list as I knew I wasnt going to complete all of these things and I thought keeping the list around would only make sense if these were still my current goals.   Otherwise, Id be a slave to my former self.<br><br>
I turned on the radio for some distraction and found it difficult to relax into the music.  Its a wicked world we live in, began playing and I found myself over analyzing the theme of this song to somewhat ridiculous extremes and turned off the music.  <br><br>
At 12 noon (hour 3), I was at a +2.5 or so and I assumed that I had reached the peak of my experience and I proceeded to try a balloon of nitrous.  The nitrous experience was very different than I had expected, but it wasnt particularly intense as it usually is with psychedelics or even just with marijuana.  I usually get distinct aural effects along with an evolving sense of expansion that I always seem to find very funny, but this wasnt the case this time and there was no wobbling.<br><br>
At 12:30 pm, I jumped in the shower with Radiohead in the background and had a great bathing experience.  Again, the music was tugging at my tear strings and I couldnt believe that I was taking these songs so seriously and to my heart.  I got dressed and went outside for an adventure to find that it was unusually warm (45 degrees) and unusually bright.  <br><br>
We had just been hit with a blizzard days earlier and now the warm sunny weather was creating massive puddles in the sidewalks.  These forced me to walk out on a semi-major street occasionally and every time I did so, I became very self-conscious, thinking that my behavior might look very strange to the people in the cars who cant see the puddles.<br><br>
At around 1:30 pm, I came to a large historic cemetery that I had never visited before and I was surprised at how beautiful and elaborate some of the monuments were there.  I felt as though the effects of the 2C-T-4 were stronger now, but would still be considered to be in the +2-+2.5 range in terms of my ability to go with them.  As I explored the various tombs, crypts and stones that were high enough to reach out of the snow, I began fantasizing about the lives of these people.  Occasionally, and more often than I would expect, I would see first or last names on the stones that happened to be the same as the ones of some close friends.   Thoughts of life and death and being remembered and the nature of history and what my life story might look like when I die floated through my mind in very jovial manner.<br><br>
An enhanced aesthetic appreciation of the monuments was also distinctly noticed.  I felt as though I was understanding and experiencing some of the original feelings and emotions of the artists who created these impressive works as well as the intentions of the people who choose these forms as a way to remember their deceased love ones.<br><br>
After about two hours there, I left the cemetery, stopped in a big super market to pick up items for dinner with little difficulty.  I got home at 4:00 pm, smoked some hash and poured a glass of Chardonnay-Semillon and relaxed in front of the boob tube.  The shows I was watching were extremely funny and I noticed myself laughing out loud much more than usual.  <br><br>
I was still at a gentle +2 when my partner and other roommates came home from work at 6:00 pm.  I gave my partner, who was the only other person aware of my experiment, a giant hug and expressed how much I missed her during the day.  We made dinner and I had a decent appetite.<br><br>
A subtle +2 remained with me throughout the rest of the evening very slowly diminishing to a +1/1.5.  I took 2 ml of GBL in some orange juice at around 10 pm to try to get my body and mind to begin preparing for sleep.  At midnight, I crawled into bed with my partner, but it was obvious that I wasnt ready for sleep. I ingested 1 mg of Xanax and went back out to the living room to watch TV.  I dozed off here and there and around 1:30 am I made my way back to bed.  My pupils were still fairly dilated when I checked them at this time, 16 hours after ingestion.  My sleep was not very deep and I awoke several times throughout the evening, but I was able to get some nice rest from about 7 am until 10:45 am and I awoke feeling pretty good with little to no after effects from my experiment the previous day.<br><br>
Conclusion and commentary: <br><br>
While this was not a particular intense or profound experience, it was certainly an interesting an enjoyable one that I plan to repeat.  I have not seen very many reports of long-lasting low dose psychedelic experiences, but I am sure that many explorers have and will encounter similar experiences even if they are not setting out to do so.  I find that these experiences can provide a very unique opportunity to explore the similarities and differences between normal and psychedelic awareness and may facilitate an integration of entheogenic insights into everyday consciousness.  <br><br>
2C-T-4 is excellent tool for such exploration.  The extended +2, which might be seen as an unwanted, half-assed psychedelic experience to some people, requires the participant to direct his experience and to do some of the work himself/herself without relying on the pharmacological strength of the compound.  However, even though 2C-T-4 is gentle in its effects, it does last a very long time and I would suggest beginning such an experiment early in the day.  Visuals were never very prominent for me, but occasional tracers were noticed.  There also was no real strong body load or headache at anytime and my mind was always pretty clear.  Sleep was difficult even at the 16 hour mark.  Next time, I would probably increase the dosage slightly and take more care for accuracy in measuring see below.     <br><br>
(Disclaimer: It is understood that eyeballing any substance is a very dangerous, stupid and unscientific method for conducting such research, but I feel it is important to include the actual methods that were used even if they were irresponsible and or reflect poorly on the generalizability of this report.)<!-- End Body -->
