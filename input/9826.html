It all started this summer when my friend S told me about this great drug called percocet.  I knew a little about it, it was supposed to fuck you up quite a bit.  But what I wanted was oxycontin.  My friend Pete had told me it was the greatest high he had ever had.  Well, Sam brought me a pill of 'percocet' which I looked at and knew immediately was really a 40mg pill of oxy.  I took it and later was messed up beyond belief, I felt wildly drunk, not very euphoric.  I ended up puking my guts out.  I didn't like oxy.<br><br>
A few months later I gave oxy another try.  I bought a 40mg pill, and cut it in half.  Then I chopped it up until it was a very fine powder.  I snorted the powder, and 15 minutes later I felt the most relaxed I have ever been in my life.  I felt great, like there was nothing that could ever touch me.  I felt perfect.  Just a feeling of well being... total euphoria.  A couple hours later I started to come down from this high, and I got worried.  I loved the high.  So I snorted the other half of the pill to get back up to the high I had earlier.  So began my obsession with oxy.<br><br>
I'm not going to get into the details, but over the next few months I spent almost all my money on oxy, which I obtained pretty cheaply, 10 bucks for a 40mg pill, and unlimited quantity.  I kept it to a weekend habit, I never was, and still am not totally addicted.  I've seen what addiction can do, so I usually cut myself off.  I read more and more about injecting it, so I thought, what the hell.  I cooked up a pill and shot it into my vein.  It was the best high I had ever had.  The intensity of the come up was so great that after 10 seconds I couldnt even stand up.  I just laid on my bed in total and complete bliss.  So from then on every time I got oxy I injected it.  I was starting to do damage to my veins, and I could see the scar tissue protruding from the skin.  My friends, who dont even smoke pot got very worried about me, so I quit oxy all together.  I stopped injecting and the wounds healed.  I didn't suffer withdrawal but I felt something was gone out of my life.<br><br>
Fast forward to last weekend.  I had some money, so I thought what the hell.  I bought 2 80mg pills and 1 40mg pill.  I had thrown my needle away and decided never to inject again, so snorting would be the administration of choice.  My friend L and I were watching requiem for a dream... and I thought to myself 'I cant watch a drug movie without being fucked up!  Now, L hadn't done ANY drugs, so I decided to scar her for life.  I set an 80mg pill on top of my binder.  She said 'T!  Whats that?' and I said 'oxy.  Its great'.  And I proceeded to chop up the entire pill into powder and snort the entire thing.  The high came on like a shockwave and I was so in bliss I was incapacitated.  We finished the movie, and she left.  I was still high, but I decided to up it a little bit, so I snorted the 40mg pill.  At that point I was so high that I felt like I never ever ever wanted to leave that feeling.  It was indescribable.  One has to experience it to understand. <br><br>
I felt great, but I wanted to smoke, so I went outside and lay on my driveway.  I dont know how many hours went by.  It was in the middle of the night.  I fell asleep in harmony.  Then I woke up, still high, but it was waning.  It was 545 AM.  I decided that I had another pill, so what the hell.  I told myself when buying I would save the other 80mg pill for later, but when you are coming down all rational thought is destroyed.  So I snorted the last pill.  Ahhh, the feeling of coming back to a high is the best feeling in the world.  I took a blanket out of my car and wrapped myself up in it on the driveway, smoking cigarettes.  They felt so good.  I was in a total dream world at that point.  Nothing mattered, I didnt think about anything, I wasn't doing anything, I was just laying.  Its not like ecstasy where you almost endure the high.  Oxy makes me feel like I want that high forever, and I never, ever EVER want to leave that spot that is my new home.  I felt so good.  I fell asleep and then finally woke up with a burn hole in my shirt and a burn on my chest, I guess I fell asleep smoking and it fell on me.  It didnt matter.  I wouldnt care if my arm was chopped off, it was bliss. <br><br>
Oxy is extremely addictive.  Although it is extremely good I wouldnt recommend doing it.  It is just one of those things where your better off being ignorant.  You see cash in your wallet, and it doesnt matter if you have expenses coming up.  You want that drug more than anything and you figure you'll find out how to pay the expense later- you just want to get high.  I was planning on upgrading my car this summer.  Plans ruined because I chose to use oxy.  I was planning on buying a new computer.  Plans ruined because I chose to use oxy.  When you're sober you know its a waste, but when you're high you would be willing to spend anything to get that high back.  Be careful.<!-- End Body -->
