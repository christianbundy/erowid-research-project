 "report": "<p>I am a 29 year old male in decent health. I have been an infrequent user of MDMA, Ecstasy and Cocaine over the past 12 years, on average taking them 3 - 4 times per year, with a few periods of more concentrated usage, so I have a good understanding of stims. I was a heavy daily cannabis user for about 5 years, but have not smoked cannabis for about 5 years. I am a regular heavy drinker. I have taken very good quality MDMA and Cocaine on a number of occasions so I can use these experiences as a point of reference.</p><p>11.30 (T -0:15) Package of Mephedrone arrives in post; off white crystals.</p><p>11.45 (T  0:00) Small amount approx 50 Mg (no scales present) taken orally at home, mixed in water; this is generally how I take MDMA. I have not eaten, but have drunk black coffee.</p><p>12.00 (T  0:15) I feel something; increased energy, euphoria, increased ability to concentrate. These effects are very mild, but noticeable. I begin to do some university work.</p><p>12.30 (T  0:45) Work is going well, it is not easy to think very logically, but it can be done with some effort. On looking at the work done later it is of a decent standard, no different to total sobriety.</p><p>12.45 (T  1:00) Feeling horny and restless, still feeling nice. I redose with approx 100Mg.</p><p>13.00 (T  1.15) Feelings of arousal increased. I jerk off, feel better than normal, no problem in achieving and maintaining erection.</p><p>13.30 (T  1.45) Definite feelings of empathy developing, feels very mild, no actual come up noticed. Restlessness increased, need to move around. Feels nice, but nothing like an MDMA high.</p><p>13.45 (T  2.00) Doing housework, this is unusual for me; I clean the bathroom, folds sheets etc. Mild but noticeable chewing develops. Slight dilation of the pupils.</p><p>14.15 (T  2.30) I go to the shop to buy cigarettes and gum. I am not a regular smoker, but like to smoke on MDMA or Cocaine. Mild confusion; want to buy Marlboro, but ask for Mayfair. No paranoia about people thinking I am on something, but human interactions require definite effort to ensure I dont sound high. Effects are still mild, but pleasant; empathy, euphoria, energy.</p><p>14.30 (T  2.45) Still feels nice, but definite need for movement. Some sweating noticed.</p><p>14.45 (T  3.00) I decide to go for a walk. Physically I feel good, no increased heart rate or other physical side effects. I redose, initially thinking 100mg, but then decide that given this RC feels quite safe decide to dose 200mg. I consider insulfating, take 5  10mg in my nostril, very definite burn, very unpleasant, decide insulfating is a bad idea, take the rest orally.</p><p>15.00 (T  3.15) BANG! I am walking through the park listening to psytrance and come up like good MDMA. Feels fantastic; euphoria, energy, empathy, sexual arousal. Compelled to run up a hill; movement definitely enhances this substance. Strong internal dialogue begins.</p><p>15.30 (T  3.45) Still feels fantastic, walking through high street, feels like floating; alert, feels like I could cope with human interaction if needed, music is very helpful to create a buffer from reality. I reach a pub, decide to drink a pint of Guinness to compensate for lack of food; no feelings of hunger, but I understand that the body needs food. Ordering a pint is no problem, but I would not want to talk to someone sober as I know I would appear quite high.</p><p>16.00 (T  4.15) Finished pint, smoked a number of cigarettes, very pleasant. Feeling very very aroused. I am straight, but consider a homosexual encounter I am so horny. Leave park and carry on walking.</p><p>16.30 (T  4.45) Walking through large park, strong internal dialogue continues, listening to old skool hiphop from my youth. Stop to stroke dog, still feels delicious like good MDMA. No desire to redose felt. Park is very large but empty save for a few dog walkers, I feel the need to bounce around to the music from time to time; when completely unobserved give into desires and really enjoy it.</p><p>17.30 (T  5.45) Back in high street, no feelings of hunger felt, but I know I needs to eat, so proceed to supermarket to buy light food such as salad. At the checkout I have a pleasant chat with the cashier about music, this is unheard of; conversation passes without incident.</p><p>18.00 (T  6.15) I arrive home. Effects are diminished considerably. I am not feeling bad, but am feeling normal and in comparison am bad. I am not sure what to do with myself. I have a protein drink and watch a cartoon. I class this as a crash, the crash lasts for about 30 mins - 1 hour. This is not painful or unpleasant, but a necessary part in the return to normality. I am very glad that I had not taken anything with me on my walk as this prevented me from being able to redose, however I was not itching to get home to get another dose.</p><p>19.00 (T  7.15) I am feeling nice and mellow, the crash has passed and I have an appetite, I manage a big bowl of vegetable stew. For the rest of the evening I am in a state of calmness, watch some films; feel nice. No desire to redose is felt; the ride has been a great roller coaster, but I know that it is best to leave it where it is than try and claw back some of that great high; chances are there would be a high price to pay.</p><p>23.30 (T 12.15) I jerk off, decide to try a little Mephedrone on my cock. Stings like hell, I clean it off quickly, seems like the chemical is very caustic it has started to strip some of the skin from my glans, I spray lots of antiseptic on it, the next day it has completely healed.</p><p>00.00 (T 12.45) I try to sleep, feel a bit restless, my head is clear, but there is background noise that keeps breaking through, some loud music even comes in; just as I start to drop off a few times a loud noise seems to occur which wakes me. I consider that this is the most unpleasant side effect of Mephedrone that I have experienced. Six months ago I took 500mg of speed and was unable to sleep properly for 3 days, this was something of an internal hell and was infinitely worse than these Mephedrone aftershocks. However the Mephedrone aftershocks seemed to be much more uncontrollable and external in nature; would be quite scary if they became strong or lasted for more than an hour or so.</p><p>01.30 (T 14.15) I fell asleep.</p><p>12.30 (T 23.15) I wake up, good sleep, no nightmares, feels normal.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>^^^^^^^^^^</p><p>* Mephedrone very closely simulated the effects of MDMA. Maybe slightly different, but comparable in terms of high.</p><p>* The high came on within 10 - 15 minutes.</p><p>* The high lasted 2 - 3 hours.</p><p>* There was a gentle return to normality; this feels a bit like a crash, the crash lasts about 1 hour.</p><p>* After the crash there was a pleasant feeling of calmness, but external stimuli may be necessary to maintain feelings of normality.</p><p>* Good sleep was possible, but there was a worrying effect of unwanted external voices in the mind for a few hours after the crash.</p><p>* This substance is highly caustic.</p><p>* This substance is a very strong aphrodisiac, but does not seriously impair the ability to gain an erection; this may be a good or bad thing.</p><p>I was very very surprised by this substance. I now think that given its ready availability, low price, excellent MDMA rivaling high and its mild comedown I would rather take this if going to a club, than buy some wrap of expensive white powder that I know nothing about.</p>"
