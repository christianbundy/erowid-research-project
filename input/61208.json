 "report": "<p>I am 23 years old, and will pay for this mistake for longer than I would like to admit. The courts say two years, let this be a sign of things to come in this story. This story may not flow very well but my memory of the events that occurred doesnt flow right either. For the record I think I ate anywhere between 2 and 3 seed pods to myself in a 4 or 5 hour window.</p><p>It is July 20th, 2006 in Colorado. I was celebrating getting a new apartment. I had brought some friends up from Denver to party with me. Normally I tend to stick with marijuana as my recreational party item, but this day was different. My friend had said that she spotted some Jimson weed outside. I had asked what it was. She told me it was a psychedelic. Three of us had decided to have some. I had made some fried chicken and all the fixins and we ate some seeds. </p><p>We didn't feel anything after 45 min except for a body high. We all decided to eat a little more. We all figured that 45 minutes was enough to digest and process the seeds, man were we wrong. </p><p>Things get fuzzy at 2 hours into the trip. Here is all that I remember. I can recall being out on my back patio staring into the river that ran behind my place. A green and black spider about 5 feet tall with legs the size of small trees wandered towards me. I wasnt scared because I remembered that I was tripping. I was amazed when the spider morphed into about 3 gold impalas which bounded off. I went inside to have a cigarette and got restless. My neighbor, whom I had known for a little while, perhaps 2 months, came down and we partied with some herbal refreshment of the green and sticky kind. After maybe a bowl or two I know I left to do something but I havent a clue what, maybe a short walk around my building due to being restless and I returned to my place. My neighbor left a few minutes after I got back.</p><p>I got the brilliant idea to have some more seeds after returning. It was at this point, after the seeds hit me that I blacked out and have no idea what happened. I wandered around as far as I know for a while longer. Here is where I get the shock of the evening. The next memory I have besides the constant movement of cigarettes is that of my friend saying that the cops were there and they wanted to see me. </p><p>I go outside thinking to myself Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, I am way too trashed to talk to the cops. So I walk up to the cop and try to introduce my self as best I could. He asks me ,Have you been up to my neighbors apartment today? I respond with something along the lines of no. He then tells me that my neighbor said I walked into her apartment and was staring at a wall while mumbling to my self. She asked me to leave at which point I did. The cop also said that she saw me in her car looking for something. I denied that as well. That didnt matter to the cops because the sober(ish) neighbor says that I did and she wants to press charges. I was told from the police when I was sober that during the ride to jail from the back seat I was singing Were going for a ride, were going for a ride! </p><p>While in jail I remember EMS checking me out at the jail, they said I was with it mentally enough that I was no danger to myself or anybody else. My vitals were fine so they allowed me to deny treatment and a trip to the hospital. My pupils were blown and my pulse was slightly fast but other than that I was fine. Such bullshit though, the truth of the matter was I was farther from just fine than anybody could have thought. I sat in a freaking chair for a day I think talking to imaginary people and real people alike. Everybody must have thought I was crazy.</p><p>The end result was that I had trespassing in the first and second degree charges pressed on me. I went to jail to detox until I was bonded out I think three days later. I had my first degree trespass deferred for two years and had to plead guilty to the second degree trespass charge to get the deferred plea bargain. </p><p>I regret this day more than any other day in my life. If I could have my way this plant would be made extinct. This plant has no real use in society thus it should be destroyed. </p><p>How does one defend their actions in court if they cant remember what the hell they were doing during whenever their supposed crime occurred? To this day I still wonder if it ever happened. All I know for sure is that I am a dumb ass for doing what I did and hope that I have not caused any permanent psychological dysfunction to the victims of my crime if it even happened. It was an incredibly bad experience.</p>"
