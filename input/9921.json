 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was 16 years old. I hadn't had any experience with psychedelics before. Just pot, pain killers, etc.. I was very interested in trying acid for a long time. Then the day came that I got my hands on some. A friend of mine talked to me in school and said he had stumbled upon a vial and asked me to buy some hits off of him(He knew I was looking to do it for awhile) I initially bought six and sold 4 of them to two friends of mine. We made plans to chill at my house that night and all take it together. My friends had experienced acid before so I figured I was in good hands. We first dosed at about 9:00. We were watching a movie and just chilling in my room. It took about a 1/2 for it to hit me. I was amazed at how powerful it was. I took one hit to start with while my buds D and M both took two. I was not expecting anything that started to happen. Everything was amazing to me. It felt like I had an understanding for how everything worked. I sat in the middle of the room, on the floor and stared at the trip-toy strobe light we turned on. <br>I don't think I've ever had a bigger smile on my face in my whole life. i just sat there, completely and utterly fascinated by how the colors looked and moved on the ceiling. All of my visuals were peaceful and happy. I felt like I was on top of the world. <br>About 2 hours into it I decided to take my other hit. By the time that hit me I was totally at one with the Universe. Me, D, and M went outside to have a cigarette. While outside I was staring at the lights of the passing cars, and just getting this wonderful, overwhelming feeling of happiness. i later discovered that it was the lights that were getting me all wound up.  That whole night was just an extrememly mind-blowing experience. I have been using acid since that and have yet to have a bad trip. I don't know if its luck or what.....\n\n\n"
