 "report": "<p>After trying Liberty Caps over 20 years ago then moving on to LSD (Purple Oms, Strawberries and the like), and not having had a trip in over 12 years, I wanted to try the new legal high of magic truffles. I ordered 100g from a company in Holland and boiled up 30g  to make tea. I had wanted my girlfriend to try psychedelics ever since I had met her and I was pleased that she agreed to do 10g - I did the other 20g. Massive feelings of raw energy on my part and my girlfriend had an entity contact experience with a gnome-like Tibetan (probably because we had the Bardo Thodol on hand in case of panic!). Strong visuals and very very friendly. I had had a bad experience on a large amount of Speed I had swallowed years ago and the psilocybin 'massaged' my soul quite a bit and really smoothed me out. Worth trying - as strong as mushrooms.</p>"
