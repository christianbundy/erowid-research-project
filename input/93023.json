It was a beautiful day, and a beautiful place for the experience.</p><p>Going down the hill toward the river, I began to feel the effects. The first effects were negative, tension, tension and depression, and they continued to grow stronger. By the time we reached the stream, the positive effects began to develop, and the stream and trees were starting to enhance in their beauty. However, I was fairly uncomfortable.</p><p>As we climbed up the hill, the experience grew in both dimensions. I became more and more uncomfortable, as though carrying a heavy load, with difficult breathing. Yet everything was slowly but steadily growing more beautiful.</p><p>The peak of the discomfort came around 1:00, somewhat before the time that Elizabeth found her 'black hole.' The discomfort was both physical and emotional. By the time we started downhill, around 4:00 p.m., the beauty was far out-weighing the discomfort, and the balance in the positive direction continued to grow the rest of the day and evening. For a short time, just before starting down, I moved into the ecstasy of celestial space. On the way down, the discomfort would return in waves, but more and more I was able to get out of it. By the end of our walk, I was enjoying the experience tremendously.</p><p>Driving home, I experienced the joy of driving with full perception, although I did develop a little tension from the confinement of driving by the time we got home. But driving was no problem, and very enjoyable. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] </p><p>Arriving home, with the stereo blasting, and Eric and a friend there, I had such a welling of emotion that I realized that I could not handle it. Fortunately, Erica and her friend left. Then I got a deep insight into myself for a lack of responsibility, and my childish way of wallowing in emotions instead of mastering them and doing what is necessary.</p><p>The evening was absolutely gorgeous. I've never seen the sky so beautiful, and thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of it. The only flaw was when I choked on some lemonade and it seemed to me, almost drowned. This has made me extremely conscious of swallowing, eating and drinking ever since. Watching the fire with our friends was a marvelous experience which we hated to see end.</p><p>I was unable to sleep the whole night. I kept working away, and working away. Mostly, I saw myself as the anti-christ, and the horrible things I was doing to everyone I knew, and my family. I have never seen my self-centeredness so clearly, and how it interferes with learning. I got many insights into other people and my relationships.</p><p>I got up at 7:00 A.M., extremely tried. I would have loved to cancel my Father's Day date in Santa Cruz, and just lay around. But I knew I must master myself. At great pain, I went to the kitchen and started to clean up from the night before. I moved like a zombie, slowly and deliberately. I took each move at a time. It was as though all previous habits were removed, and I had to weigh and decide each act. I had an awful lot to do, and it seemed hopeless, but I knew I must do each step, no matter what the cost. The pain was insignificant, because it is the decision that counts, and I must learn to override the pain.</p><p>Everything got done, and we left the house right on time. Once in the car, everything got easier, and the drive was very beautiful. I had a calm, peaceful, and most enjoyable day, with much learning and insight, albeit, a little languid. The drive home along the coast was very beautiful, and I got quite energized, although Holly experienced some illness from over-eating.</p><p>The next morning I had a fine talk with Greg, after which I experienced some very unusual anxiety. But I was most clear-headed and creative. I killed the anxiety with a carbohydrate lunch, and learned why people often eat as they do.</p><p>I felt the experience continues for many days, and feel that it is one of the most profound and deep learning experiences I have had.</p><p>I would like very much to try Aleph-4 again, and would particularly like to block out more time for it.</p>"
