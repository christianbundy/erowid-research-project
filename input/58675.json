 "report": "<p>I have been using Coke for about a year in small amounts, the odd line given free from a friend. The last 6 months though I have regulary bought coke, at first I would buy a gram and it would last a weekend, then I regulary bought 2 grams on a weekend and more recently I have been buying 3-4 grams and whatever was left using this during the week. Although to be honest their was rarely much left for the week. The highs intially were good but I found increasingly that I built a tolerance and was left feeling increasingly disapointed with the high, and to compensate was doing more and more.</p><p>This along with the high cost lead to a decision, to quit. Here lay the suprise, I made a new years resolution to stop,and have for 8 days now whilst this may not seem a long time I have had an increasing calling in my head to get more. I naivley assumed you could just stop taking this stuff, however I dream about it every night wake up in cold sweats, it occupies my mind constantly, and whilst I havent given in to this calling I often find myself feeling panicky about having given up. I have tried many drugs before and enjoyed them recreationally.</p>"
