Acquired 25 grams Mimosa Hostilis, 10 grams Syrian Rue (Peganum harmala) extract that was had 4:1 ratio. Prepared a pitcher of 1 part lemon juice, 2 parts water, 250mg ascorbic acid (vitamin C).<br><br>
Dumped MH and Rue into cooking pot, covered with lemonmixture. Began praying Sanskrit mantras and sending positive energy to the brew from my third eye. Simmered at 190 F for 20 minutes, strained through new pantyhose. Squeezed out richest drops, repeated procedure a total of four times. Set overnight in pantry in sealed tupperware bowl. Thought about the brew all the nest day till I got home to it, giving it love and praying to it to take me for a walk. Through the 64 dimensions.<br><br>
It took myself and someone else 30 minutes to drink the Ayahuasca, split into two drinks, of course. Within another halfhour of finishing the drinks, we purged, one after another. One must keep the drink down until you feel the effects or they will go nowhere at all. I suggest you do not take any other substances, no alcohol, and no food. Do not roll or get drunk, not only is it taking a shit on the brew of the formless creator, you will probably die.<br><br>
Once you feel the effects, go and purge. It is a positive experience to purge as all negativity is pushed out. As I got up from the toilet from my knees, I knew that the veil between the dimensions was thinner due to the DMT opening up the bandwidth to receive the signal from formless nameless god. I was aware of beings in my bathroom, and one I saw out of the corner of my eye and when I turned it was still there. It was bewildered at the sight of me, as if I looked like a smoky ghost in its dimension. I gave it love from my third eye and it sent me postivity and faded.<br><br>
I believe that DMT is released from your brain when you die and evacuates the soul. You could OD on DMT, but it would be a literal death. You would actually evacuate your soul. One must find god in formlessness to know where to go at time of evacuation or else once the bandwidth is open, you will go through and instantly forget and merely be reassigned top another point on the life meridian grid.<br><br>
I found that third eye meditation with pranayama breathing and Alex Gray mindfold goggles caused me to reach a wonderful understanding.<br>
(BTW the trails are amazing, the colors blah blah blah.) I began to seek god through these myriad universes that I saw in my third eye. It came to me. Like a child in the presence of the sun I marveled at the millions of faces and eyes and soft colors.<br><br>
I thought to it 'I have no questions at this point.'<br><br>
It thought back 'you are one with me'<br><br>
Then it multiplied exponentially, I began to fall from my seat on the edge of the tub, I came back before injury.<br><br>
I returned to the vast nameless all encompassing god after I sat in <br>
another room. As I arrived through the bandwidth, a message was running across the scene, like fast tickertape. I slowed it down and it said, 'the source of all creation is the flow of time itself'<br><br>
I came back, got a pen and pad, and went through again. I asked for a symbol and my hand was taken and led through a design to symbolize what IT ALL IS, in that specific portion of time and space as it is ever changing, the formless nameless true god.<br><br>
At this point an hour and a half had elapsed since ingestion. I took two hits from a glass full of dank, and consumed a piece of whole wheat bread. The trip picked back up and this time, having felt that I had enough to dig on for awhile on the sober course in the afterward, I lay on the floor and just watched my mind for awhile.<br><br>
The come down was gorgeous, no stupid back aches or stomach cramps. No wanting to sleep and can't. A cat on the internet said 'mushrooms are the dialect of the language of DMT.'  DMT is a true entheogen in that it won't hurt you IF YOU HAVE NO DEMONS (in that I mean, you can accept the truth from your cosmic eternal encoding for physical life and follow it instead of suppressing because you think it would be too hard to change something to follow the true flow. when you deny the Truth of your self, coming through in signals from god, fear and rage form. These are manifested when ingesting hallucinogens as dragons and monsters and shit eating you alive.) DMT pops your cestial antenna up and out in full array to receive the signal.<br><br>
Any fool can pop some lysergic and live, but DMT is an eye opener.<br>
I've taken lysergic maybe 200 times. No experience adds up to the epiphany of ayahuasca. I do not recommend anybody consume ayahuasca until they understand the Truth. This is knowledge, not the answer. Take this knowledge and form your own answer. Too many times in human history folks encounter a new concept or idea and take is as an answer or a lie, when in fact any new thing is just knowledge. When something is taken for anything but knowledge, as a variable for your personal equation, it is forced into the equation, and you end up hurting other people, getting committed, or just plain going the fuck off at some point when you equation breaks.<br>
THIS IS JUST KNOWLEDGE. USE IT TO FORM AN ANSWER THAT WORKS FOR YOU.<br>
I send love and peace to my fellow travelers.<br><br>
The whole experience lasted about 2 and 1/2 hours, with peak after the first 45 minutes. No OTC meds were taken, fasting was done for one day prior. The someone else that was with me had a wonderful experience as well, but doe not wish to share it with the net.<br><br>
Can you believe a tea made from tree bark, flower seeds and a lemon is illegal?<!-- End Body -->
