 "report": "<p>I'm not an avid drug user, but I came across a few Ambien, 10mg pills at my friends house the last time I was over. His mother is prescribed them for chronic insomnia which I truthfully have also, however, I decided to recreationally take 25mg. Since no one else has written up an experience as it happens with Ambien, I figured I'd give it a shot.</p><p>Current settings:</p><p>- Stomach contents: Empty.</p><p>- Time: Night (12:33am)</p><p>- Setting: Room inside of parents house.</p><p>- Usage: First time.</p><p>- Mood: Calm.</p><p>- No other substances have been injested to alter the effects of the drug.</p><p>12:34:</p><p>I've injested two and a half pills, which equates to roughly 25mg with about 3oz of water. A few seconds after taking the two and a half pills, I feel an immediate but very small sense of relaxation coming over me.</p><p>12:47:</p><p>I am begining to feel my limbs getting more and more relaxed and a state of peacefulness coming over my body and mind.</p><p>1:03:</p><p>I feel the effects setting much stronger now. I keep having thoughts of people talking in a room, but not the same room I am in. I will try and explain. I cannot see 'the people' like you would see visual hallucinations with shrooms or DMT. I see them somewhat in my head, only I have my eyes open. Kind of like a subconcious vision. My hand eye quordinaiton is off, and when I stood up to use blow my nose, I fell down twice. I'm also experiencing bionocular vision.</p><p>1:17:</p><p>I feel very tired right now, but I will try and remain awake. It took me about five minutes to type this line because the keys on the keyboard seem so close to me and I cannot control my finger movement properly. Right now I feel like I'm drunk, although in my personal opinion, I have a lot more control over myself when I'm drunk. I've never fallen down while intoxicated on alcohol. I've fallen twice now mearly by standing up. I can't imagine what it would be like trying to drive.</p><p>1:39:</p><p>For me, the drug is peaking right now. I'm having a very hard time thinking and I'm experiencing amnesia. I'm seeing small specks of light flashing in my peripheral vision and I'm also experiencing a rather interesting state of mental confusion. I keep asking myself what I am. And answering the question is slowed and a challenge. The feeling I'm having in my head is rather awkward, it's as if someone is behind me and pressing on the side of my head directly to the left and right of my ears. It's not painful, but almost a numbness that races through my body, but does not remain in any location for an extended period of time.</p><p>Everything also seems surreal as well. I know that the lamps I have on my table have been there for years, but they seem so interesting now. I can't help but stare at them for extended periods of time, expecting them to say something or maybe move. I'm seeing people laughing now in my 'head'. My eyes are still open, but I can see them in sort of a greyish blue color. Sort of like what you see when you close your eyes and try to sleep. I do not hear anything they are saying however, I am talking to myself as well as 'them' trying to imagine what they are talking about. I'm trying to converse with them, even though I have not been directly asked a question or even looked at. It seems like I'm inside of a room where I cannot be seen or heard, but I can see everything these 'people' are doing.</p><p>1:51:</p><p>I've got a small headache and my balance and quordination are still off. I got up to go to the bathroom and I fell down again. It's a lot different than alcohol because I know when I get up after drinking heavily, I'm going to stumble about in a stupor. With Ambien, it's a total surprise. I can be sitting down feeling in total control and then stand up and fall without warning. </p><p>2:13:</p><p>I've decided to lay down now. I'm very tired due to the drugs, and due to the fact that it's now 2:00am. </p><p>The next day, 11:28:</p><p>I've awoke to a normal state of mind, no drug induced 'hangover' and no tiredness or mental confusion like the effects of waking up after taking a large sum of benzodiazepines. Although I do not remember what I dreamed about or if I even dreamed at all. I will try this drug again should I come across it.</p>"
