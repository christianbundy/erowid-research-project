On the 29th May 2006 my flatmate G and myself went on the best drug experience of my life. That is probably why it will probably be my last, I just can't see myself topping it.<br><br>
Mindset<br><br>
G had previous experience with magic mushrooms, while I had only every smoked pot and taken BZP pills (these are legal where I am from), and he knew that I was keen to give the shroomys a go. He had managed to get some from one of is mates and we set a date to take them. There was reasonably short notice but I had just over a week of advance knowledge of the trip. I am currently at university and this is a busy time of the year so I was reasonably stressed. About four days before the trip I had gotten about 8 hours sleep in 56 hours trying to get all my assignments and projects finished before the trip. This turned out very well as it meant I had a couple days of stress free relaxation before the trip, and I felt in full confidence of taking the shrooms. To summarise my mindset I was very relaxed, though still had butterflies in my stomach, (this was due to having previous experience of trying to take magic mushrooms and having them being duds or spread around to many people to have any real effect). I also felt safe having G there, though I now wish we had a sober observer.<br><br>
Setting<br><br>
In the middle of the city we live in there is a nice big park with big fields, trees, ponds and animal life. This was the location we decided to take the shrooms, chances that we would encounter other people at that time would be minimal. Later on we ended up at one of our blazing spots and then back to our flat. It was a cold night with a bit of moisture around but not raining. G was disappointed at this as he said that the rain is a good experience on shrooms.<br><br>
Preparations<br><br>
As I have said I had gotten all of my uni work out of the way, so had no pressing commitments. I had read in some of the experiences online that you should think about maybe fasting for a week before hand or just eating fruit. I decided not to do this as I dont eat much as it is. I made sure that I had some fruit with me in my bag in case I felt like it during the trip. We were meant to go on the trip with another of our mates but he decided not to as he didnt feel comfortable. We respected this and proceeded the two of us.<br><br>
Dosage, Timing and the Trip.<br><br>
G had made up the tea a few days before hand. It contained about 50 shrooms, 700 ml of water and lots of tea bags and sugar. It was meant to be for 3 maybe 4 of us hence the quantity.<br><br>
Time: 5:30 pm<br><br>
After driving to the park we each drank about 100 ml of the tea each and wandered off to a park bench in the park. After sitting there for around 10 minutes we decided to have some more of the tea. We returned to the car and had another 100  150 ml each. Pretty much after finishing our second helping we could start to feel the first bit coming on. I felt a tingling sensation over my body with it most noticeable around my head and face. We quickly went back to the park bench to enjoy the start of the trip.<br><br>
Time 6:00 pm<br><br>
Could definitely start to feel the shrooms now and was starting to notice my vision going weird. The first thing I noticed was that I was seeing a slight double of most but not all things. The ground was also looking like swells on the ocean. Where we were sitting there was a nice collection of trees around, but this was blocking the dieing rays of the sun so we moved to a small pond where there was some artificial lighting. This is were they kicked in hard. The moss on the ground was moving around in patterns and the mower marks on the grass were very intriguing.<br><br>
Time about 6:30 pm<br><br>
We decided a change of scenery was in order so wondered over to the duck pond. We had to walk through a bushy grotto to get there and this was fascinating to walk through and look at. There was a fountain in the duck pond, and the water falling back to the pond was creating a nice background. At this stage we were laughing our heads off at anything and everything and were occasionally having trouble string syllables, let alone sentences together.<br><br>
Time Not a Clue<br><br>
For the next couple of hours we have no clue were we exactly are or what time it is. I make the comment that we probably look like a couple of crazy people the way we were carrying on, and the few people who came across were polite enough to ignore us. I became very in touch with nature and ended up hugging every tree I came across. We came across a man made sign post in the trees and we were thinking why is this here. I must also say at around this point I realised that I have a face, and skin. G said this was common. This led to a feeling that I was just a head as I had lost apparent feeling of my body. It just plain felt like I didnt have one. After wondering around talking to every bush and tree I came across, we found a nice spot to sit down and we just talked.<br><br>
Time: 9 ish pm<br><br>
With most of our body control back we wondered back to the car to warm up. G thought he was okay to drive <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> so we headed off to our smoking spot (I am fully against operating a car under any form of influence but I was to smashed to care at the time). Our smoking spot is on top of a hill/mountain in the city were you can see the whole city. Up here we each had a couple of bowls of cannabis in a bong. This kicked the visuals of the shrooms back in but not any of the ill effects of limited motor control.<br><br>
Surprisingly neither of us suffered any paranoia, could be because we smoke quite a bit of pot, especially on this hill. After tripping out at the patterns on the dash board of the car I shut my eyes for some reason. This blew me away. I had experienced mild closed eye visuals with cannabis before but this was out of this world. Any bad experiences of the trip was made worth while for those visuals. On opening my eyes I was having open eyed visuals of the sort where existing things are just slightly animated.<br><br>
Time: 11 ish pm<br><br>
We now headed back to our flat. Bad move. I didnt feel comfortable at that setting at all. It started me thinking to much, which led to those talked about life changing experiences. These were a massive roller coaster ride of emotions for me which I feel lucky to have come out on the positive side of. I have never felt more positive and less pessimistic in my life.<br><br>
Time: Midnight ish<br><br>
I went and had a shower which was weird as it still didnt feel like my body. I then hit the bed and had the best nights sleep for a long time, waking up with the dawn and having a very productive day at uni the next day.<br><br>
Summary<br><br>
Would I recommend magic mushrooms to anyone? Fucking a I would.<!-- End Body -->
