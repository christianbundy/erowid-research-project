 "report": "<p>I have been using opiates on an almost daily basis for the last year. I have never been able to bring myself to stick a spike in my arm, but I snort oxycontin,morphine and swallow hydrocodone tablets like they are nothing. the other day I came across what the guy called opana. I was thinking it would be just another shitty pain killer like tramadol that does nothing for you. I was wrong. I removed the coating with water and snorted it on my way to a show in another city. </p><p>It took about 20 min to hit me due to the fact that this specific pill gels up to prevent injection. It dripped down in one solid clump and hit me hard. It felt like I had done 60 mg of oxycontin. it was a particularly warm evening and I was uncontrollably sweating and pale as a ghost, but felt great. this drug is probably 3-5 times stronger per mg than oxycontin so be careful if you are not very expierienced with opiates.</p>"
