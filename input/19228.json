 "report": "<p>One day, I can't remember when, I was at college. It was hot, the sun was shining, I was sitting on the field with my friend C and some blokes smoking a joint. I had half a joint I think, with C and then I could not talk again. I was very quiet. I felt very distant to everyone, like they were all a million miles away and I was an alien orbiting them. I couldnt connect with them. I dont remember thinking about anything. I just remember sitting and not thinking, feeling a bit weird and starting to feel a little depressed by it. C pointed it out, she laughed at me. I couldnt say anything in my defense. I didnt know what was wrong.</p><p>That was the first time. What I didnt know is that that was just the beginning. I started smoking draw less but when I did smoke I was usually fine. But my experiences with other drugs were getting worse. They made me freak out, unbelievable paranoia, like believing through and through that 50,000 people at a rave were out to get me. Then hash stopped being nice. I would smoke and a whole new world would open up to me. I saw my friends as they really were, deceitful, liars, trying to control me, define me. Showing me how to behave and act. Show me I was a bad, weird person. I thought they used to imitate me so that I could see how strange I was, that I didnt act right. Paranoia. Paranoia. Paranoia. I wouldnt speak. I would just stare into nothing, unable to look at anyone.</p><p>I quit my job and started staying at home a lot. Curtains drawn, not answering my phone, not getting off the couch. After a while I couldnt go on the net anymore, I thought they were spying on me on there as well. I couldnt leave my house sometimes, I knew they were watching, even if I went to London to get away- they were aware of my every move. I went in and out of thinking the phone was bugged and there were cameras in the house. I spent all my time figuring out their conspiracies, trying to work out everything that was wrong with me. The list was so long and the thoughts so caning, that I tried several times to kill myself. </p><p>My parents were getting fed up of the 5am knock on their door with me telling them to take me to hospital, Id overdosed. Once I spent a week in the psychiatric ward. I also got sent to a rehab centre because they thought I was addicted to alcohol and cannabis. I stayed there for six weeks. None of this would have happened if it wasnt for that paranoia. Dont get me wrong I smoked weed for two years and loved it until this happened. I was going to try and describe the paranoia but its so hard to explain when it comes down to it. I can use examples but I cant really get across what it was like. Partly because the memories fading but also cause it confuses me, and still does.</p><p>I guess it's like discovering my whole life has been a lie. That I are a lie. That what I thought I knew is not true and is merely a cover up to the truth. I feel as though I am learning the truth, my eyes are wide open now but what I see is shit-scary and depressing. Its like one huge hellish nightmare that I can't escape. I have no one to turn to because they will use it against me; they could be one of them and anything I ever say - they already know. They know how I feel, what I do and what I think. Its like they can read my mind. I just have to figure out how they know this. It's me against them but I'm not really sure who THEY are either. And learning and knowing all this, is a hard thing to cope with. How do I talk to people that already know what I'm gonna say? How do I tell someone what I decided to do when they are the ones that got me to make that decision? How do I walk around being normal when I know I am being watched but can't see the person thats watching me. And no one believes what I think my friends are doing and I'm starting to feel crazy; I want to smoke weed again but when I do, this all happens again.  I want to go outside, but I'm terrified, I AM completely trapped and the only way to escape is to die. It seems an easy choice,  living like that, which isnt really living at all, OR sweet, harmless death where I will not have to feel or think again.</p><p>What choice would you make..How would you cope?  </p><p>The truth is somehow I did manage to cope, it took me a long year but eventually Ive sorted it out. Im back at college, Im planning to go to university next year. I even have a job, working around lots of people behind a bar. I still do some drugs, well most drugs except cannabis. To be honest Im too scared to touch it. Just in case it happens again. I have a lot of new friends that I see all the time and I can talk to if I really need to. My parents have helped a lot. I guess I can get over it. I wouldnt have believed you if you had said it to me but its true. So if you have been through anything like this or still are- dont give up. You just need to find your way of getting better. Dont be afraid to ask for help.</p>"
