First off I want to tell you my background, im 16 years old and yea like most 16 year olds I have a troubled home life. Im the regular younger brother drug user, my older brother had introduced me to everything even Dramamine.  <br><br>
I had experimented with Dramamine before highest dosage would be  20 pills (50mg) each. Each time was a horrid trip, with nausea hallucinations and so on. The amazing effect of how it brings me to a different world that seems so real. I was a dreamer and at the time (4 days ago from typing this) I hated the normal world.<br><br>
The only stability I really had was my girlfriend and my mom. But 3 days ago things were going bad, I wont go into detail because you could care less about my personal life but basically me and my dad had got into a fight and it got physical. I was through. I had lost all my friends, parents trust, and sanity. All I had was bruises and a bottle of motion sickness pills. I was scared of death but I wanted to die (does that make sense?) <br><br>
So I popped 30 of them (not much? bullshit those things taste like shit 30 was a lot even for 5 at a time) I wasn't ready to puke so I took a break at 30 and decided if nothing was going on I would take more. After that I took a bath dried up and went to my room. During that time I set on some music to calm me down. I sent a last message to my girlfriend which was spelled to shit I couldn't type it was kicking in. I turned off the lights and lay down. <br><br>
The weight of the drug kicked in my mouth went numb and I started shaking horribly like I was having a seizure I kept thinking I should scream of try to get to my parents but I had gone to far to pussy out now. The posters in my room were rippling and shaking up and down, then I closed my eyes and opened them only to notice the posters were black the walls had a blue tint and I kept trying to see the posters nothing but black though. I said fuck this and tried to go to sleep. Then I woke up for a split second and the radio was booming louder and louder to my name whispered and yelled I heard wesley WESLEY. I had to turn it off, so I reached out my arm only to notice a spider crawling on it I couldn't scream I felt suppressed so I swiped it off my arm only to look further down my room and see a man in a robe standing over my bed. It seems funny now that I think that the robe looked very much like a KKK outfit but at the time it seemed like he was waiting for me to die. I blacked out.<br><br>
Then I woke up again in the living room how I got there I still have not clue, I was screaming and yelling there biting me. I felt like bugs spiders ticks fleas were all biting me. I could see them everywhere I turned, and my dad said there was probably fleas from the dog (yes he's a fucking idiot). I turned to my mom pointing out the bugs slapping myself. I would look at my leg hairs and it looked like the hair was moving like a dead spiders legs. I took at bath slapping myself trying to get them off of me. It hurt so bad. I couldn't grab anything ether I would reach for something and it seemed like my hand would go right through it. Afterwards they were still on me I wept to my mom and pleaded for help. She suggested it was paranoia then said maybe I should go take a shower, so I did. <br><br>
Ok this fucking sucked I got into the shower and then noticed wasp were flying in it I screamed and stayed under the water still getting bit. I ran out crying and jumped in her bed with wet clothes I kept saying to myself its paranoia your tripping and somehow went to sleep. <br><br>
After that I woke up, and I was still hallucinating I could see bugs everywhere. I was shaking and kept forgetting what I have to do. My mom asked me to go get her cell phone charger and I attempted 5 times and came back confused. I confessed to her what I did. Till today Im scared 24/7  <br><br>
I shake, I hallucinate, Im afraid of the dark and I feel like I can see through my eyelids. Im always tired but to scared to sleep. And the bugs are everywhere.<br><br>
I kinda calmed down today after confessing to my girlfriend what happened she comforted me, and I believe its getting out of my system, I can barely hold food down, my heart and chest is sore, its very hard to breath and remember little things. I didn't go to the hospital for fear of them locking me up as a crazy.<!-- End Body -->
