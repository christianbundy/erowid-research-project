 "report": "<p>It was about 9:30 at night and I was rather bored. I'd read some bad stuff about dramamine but I had a box of Tylenol Simply Sleep so I figured what the hell. </p><p>[Erowid Note: Dramamine is dimenhydrinate, Tylenol Simply Sleep is  diphenhydramine]</p><p>I started out being very cautious, taking 150mg (6 pills) around 9:45. Felt nothing, and over the next two hours I bumped it up to 850mg (34 pills). During this time I'd had about half a bottle of water but I found myself having to go to the bathroom (right next to my room from the hall) a lot, which would set a trend for the night. The whole time I'd been reading stuff online and chatting. About 12:00, something caught the corner of my eye. I wear contacts and didn't have them or my glasses on so my vision was a little poor. It looked like a big cricket crawling on my ceiling. I looked at it for a minute or so and it was crawling towards the corner of the wall, away from me. Eventually I took a magnifying glass and got close enough to realize it was a staple that has been on the ceiling for as long as I can remember... Then I looked down at a box by my desk and saw the seemingly typical gelatinous/clear creature. I watched it crawl around for a while. It then sunk into a box and a man rose up from it on his back, then faded through the wall. </p><p>At this point I'm still in reality - I know it's all fake, though I lose track of time. Sometime around 1:45 I turned the computer off. My friend told me the next day that was when I went offline, otherwise I wouldn't have known when I left. Apparently I took my headphones off, which I almost always have on, turned the tv off, turned the lights off. From here on time gets really weird. I'm standing in the middle of my room, it's all dark; not sure how I got there since I don't actually remember turning everything off. All I can see is my hands which are glowing purple or blue, which illuminate about a foot around them. I need to use the bathroom again, great... So, feeling very heavy and not being able to see a lot, I walk across my room towards the door. On the way I knocked over a table and my water on top of it. From what I could see, the table was a foot to the right of me yet I knocked it over, so I'm feeling around on the floor to pick it up. I walk a few more feet til I can see the door. I reach out to open it but my hand goes through the knob. </p><p>I wouldn't be able to feel the knob had it been there since I was completely numb. I feel around everywhere for where the knob should be and eventually, a foot beyond the door I see, I feel the physical door. My mind was totally miscalibrated with my actual surroundings. As I open the door I try to open it how I usually would but it will only open the opposite way, so my door swings out into the hall where it should have swung into my room. I turn the corner in the hall to open the bathroom door which is also inverted, so both doors are now open in the hall they cross eachother (which is completely impossible based on how the house is built). Now I feel like I'm trapped. I struggle with the two doors for what seemed like 30 minutes (which very well could have been) until I finally make it into the bathroom. I don't remember even hitting the lights inside but I'm sure everything went well. Walking back to my room turns out to be another 15 minute task... Once inside I shut the door, manage to knock the table over again. </p><p>I try to lay on the bed I see but end up a foot short of it, whacking my head on the bed post. Sounds were amplified. It made a very loud boom and I was sure everyone in the vicinity of my house had heard it, though I couldn't feel any pain. I estimate it's about 3:00 or 4:00 now and I'm using all my energy to just lay down in bed... After whacking my head maybe 5 times I make it. My arms have too much energy built up in them to relax, though I'm dead tired. They itched and shook and I couldn't keep them still. After a few minutes I had to use the bathroom again... I go out in the hall and it's atleast 5:30 by now as the lights in the house are on, meaning my parents are awake. I was lucky enough not to run into them. I made it to the bathroom and back with not quite as much effort, maybe 10 minutes. Finally I was able to lay down and relax - fell asleep pretty much instantly. </p><p>At 6:30 I was woken up for school. Reality and the physics of the physics in my mind were once again in sync - I just felt very heavy. I got up and managed to take a bath, in which I noticed paracitical-looking flat worms swimming everywhere. I realized they weren't real, though, and maintained composure. I was a bit weak pretty much the whole day, though surprisingly rested. I saw minor visuals which looked like prismatic sandstorms til noon. All in all the hangover was not bad. The most interesting part of the experience was not knowing if my eyes were open for the early hours of the morning, from 2:00 to 5:00, maybe later. I guess I was recalling what the house looked like from my mind, with some discrepancies, like being a foot or so off on all coordinates and the doors working in reverse. I've read a lot of nasty stuff about dramamine but my experience wasn't really positive or negative, just interesting and thought-provoking (for me atleast). </p><p>Nothing about it really freaked me out, and the euphoria was only present a few minutes after I finished taking the last pills, which ended as my coordination fell and my head grew heavy. My dose was rather high for a first time, which could have been why semiconscious, dissociative dream-like sequences dominated over the visual and auditory halluncations that I'd heard about. I plan on trying this again sometime, though ideally with a sitter and a slightly lower dose. I'll definitely space things out, not taking it twice in the same month, maybe longer. I'm not sure if I lucked out this time or if it just works differently from person to person. Maybe a little of both... I probably don't have to say that the effects have just as much to do with the person, their mindset and surroundings as it has to do with the chemistry.</p>"
