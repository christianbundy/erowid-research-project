Experience: First time with Iprocin (4-HO-DiPT). I also have experience with Mescaline, 2C-I, 2C-E, LSD, LSA, Mushrooms, Miprocin (4-HO-MiPT), Salvia, DXM, Ketamine, MDMA, MDA, Methylone, IAP and Cannabis as for the 'mind' drugs. <br><br>
Mindset: Good mood, but had some personal issues on my mind <br>
Method of Dosing: Oral, capsule. <br>
Trip Dose and Duration: 20mgs<br>
Medications: None. <br><br>
This is my first time with the chemical 4-AcO-MiPT, but I have tried 4-HO-MiPT at 12mgs before. Anyhow, I had planned to take 20mgs of this chemical tonight, and so I did, and my friend well call Bobby took 18mgs with me. I had not expected what came, but as fearful as it was, I would never regret. <br><br>
I ingested the capsule at around 8PM, and I went to State lake for the trip. I parked my car a good ways away from the lake along the parking lot. We were next to a trail that led into the woods. I was listening to Tools album Lateralus while the drug was taking effect, though it was just at an alert phase at the time. Bobby was irritating me slightly at first because he was talking about TV shows, and I am really not into normal recreational activities/conversation while tripping. However, it wasnt long before the feelings inside my body started to crawl into my mind. <br><br>
I was feeling an onset similar to a high dose of mushrooms, though I was even more shaky inside. It was somewhat uncomfortable, but definitely bearable. I put on a CD composed of mostly instrumental music from Enigma, Dark Tranquillity, Finntroll, Soulfly, and Shpongle, but it had Horse with No Name, and a couple songs from the Moody Blues as well. Me and Bobby walked over by the trail, and the body feelings were still growing in intensity. At around 9PM, The mental and visual aspects of the drug were starting to reveal themselves as all of the trees in front of me started to gain personalities. The patterns in the bark started to form faces, and the forest became alive. I felt like I was in the jungle. There was a beauty in this place that Ive never seen before. It was hard to believe that I was still in North America, let alone the state where I live. <br><br>
After that, the effects grew rapidly. I had an overwhelming feeling of rushing inside of me. I had an urge to dance as the mushroom-like visuals swirled about the trees and sights where I was. The body feeling was quite reminiscent of mushrooms as well, yet there was still a character to the drug that was profoundly different than any other Tryptamine that Ive taken. I stretched my body and extended my arms to the sky, as I felt a feeling of physical, psychological, and spiritual ecstasy flow throughout my body. I could feel and visually experience a spiritual presence radiating into and out of my soul. It felt like a release.<br><br>
I had not even noticed that Bobby had walked away from me. He was petting a black and white cat that had walked over to him. There were people at the lake, and he thought it belonged to one of them. However, they left, and the cat was still there. It was an extremely friendly cat, yet I could see a wildness within it. We were talking about how humans tamed the beast when they domesticated animals like this, yet there is still and instinct within the animal that is wild. I kept telling Bobby that I could tell this was a wild cat that just happened to be friendly. It had no owner. I laughed hard at this cat, though I couldnt really figure out why. I was analyzing Bobbys affectionate nature towards animals, and my laughter was numbing. I hadnt felt that feeling of intense laughter in a while. I couldnt quit. Bobby said if the cat was still there when we left that he would take it with us. I told him that I felt it belonged in the wild, and from there the cat ran up into the woods. We smoked a joint during the whole process of interacting with this animal. <br><br>
It was around 9:30PM that the trip got so intense that it was no longer pleasurable. It was Godly. My visuals had gone away, and before me was a full blown hallucination. The hallucination morphed so rapidly that I couldnt even make out what it was. There was no color to the world. Black &amp; white was all that I saw until God appeared as the body of an octopus tearing through the skyline, ripping trees out of the ground with his tentacles. Again, I felt these evil spirits flooding out of my body, and ascending into the sky being destroyed by this creature, this beautiful being that had came to me. Throughout the whole experience, I got a strong feeling that I was being given spiritual gifts from something that repeatedly came to me. After this vision, the music I was listening to went away in my head. It was playing, I could see it. ..But it could not be heard. Bobby was still experiencing the onset of the drug, and I had to warn him that something was on its way, and he too would experience the fearful respect for the Creator.<br><br>
We then went for a walk, as some people had came down and had soul music playing. The music was overlapping, and it created an intense confusion in my head. As we walked, we talked and thought about many things. Death was the biggest topic of my thought. I felt as if I was really getting a grasp on what death is and how it relates to mankind. It was as if I was ready to accept it when my time came. Death has never before seemed so beautiful to me. Life is amazing, but the question of what lies after death is even greater. I want to live for something eternal even if all I possess in the end is a lost memory. God showed me a glimpse of death that night. ..A glimpse of heaven. I wish to keep my feelings towards this and the rest of this part of the trip secret. <br><br>
We walked to the beach and there were many geese along the shore. They seemed angry as I approached, and they appeared ready to hold their ground. I wasnt wanting to get attacked by a flock of geese, so I walked back to the cement before the beach. Me and Bobby found a large toad. I held the toad, and we just looked at it for a while. I thought to myself this was created. Life is amazing. It seemed as this whole trip revolved around animals. Even God appeared to me as an animal. We talked about time and eternity as we walked back to the car. <br><br>
I put on the CD once again, and my trip was slowly fading, but that feeling of fading was something to be cherished. It was absolutely beautiful, and believe it or not, it held the deepest and most colorful visuals. I shut my eyes as I listened to Flute Fruit by Shpongle. I was so filled with spiritual euphoria and visuals of a very complex nature. There are no words. I had a true peak experience, ++++ that night. It started to really wear down after 11PM. Bobby had a very intense experience as well, but only a +++. He kept talking about how 'in tune' I am with nature. He says that I know many things that others don't. He seemed to really be getting through things in his thinking. <br><br>
Overall, this is an amazing chemical, though I believe it is one that people should be extremely careful with when dosing. Its nature is similar to that of Psilocybian mushrooms, though it does have a very unique character. Its depth is amazing. I have also tried 4-HO-MiPT at 12mgs, and I found it to be even more unique at that dosage. It had a strong feeling of pleasant body rolling, and it was very intense as well. I went to see fireworks that night, and I had a very pleasurable time. I do hope to experiment with the 4-HO-MiPT more. I cannot say one negative thing about it, though at the dosage of 20mgs with the 4-AcO-MiPT there were some physical side effects that felt slightly uncomfortable. ..Nothing major though.<!-- End Body -->
