A Son´s Report: 2-CB
</h3>
<p>
Recently, I had my first experiences with a psychedelic 
drug known as 2-CB. What makes this unusual 
compared to most people´s experiences is that I tried it 
with my mother. I´ll admit this is certainly not a typical 
parent-child bonding; however, my mother and I are 
not a typical family. We have a rapport far more like 
that of friends. She has always supported me in 
whatever decision I made in my life whether it was to 
backpack across Europe or go to college and earn a 
degree in Engineering (the latter is my current pursuit). 
She has done her best to help me follow my dreams. 
</p>
<p>
 I recently visited my mother in her home in California 
for two weeks. On one of those evenings her friends 
invited us to join them- they had several doses of 2-CB 
and they were offering my mother and I each a hit. As I 
said, this was my first experience with 2-CB and I was a 
bit nervous about the idea of trying something new. 
Having my mother there was a big help in making my 
decision; not so much for maternal security, but 
because she is like an old friend, someone whom I´ve 
known forever and for whom I have a great deal of 
trust. 
</p>
<p>
 My description of the experience can only be worded 
as having a very strange animated film in my mind. 
When I closed my eyes, the ghost images left from 
lights and white objects would fade into strange but 
identifiable characters which would become animated, 
changing shape and color until eventually they would 
form a repetitive screen like a cloth pattern or an 
Escher print. I could start the process anew by opening 
my eyes briefly and closing them again. It is a mild 
hallucinogen, although very long lasting and without 
the bad side effects that some people get from LSD. 
I´m glad I had the opportunity to discuss the effects 
with my mother and to compare them to her own. I´m 
sure that the majority of the people in the world do 
not have such a relaxed relationship with their parents. 
I am fortunate because this experience was a very 
strong bonding for us. I will always remember this 
experience with 2-CB and that my mother was there to 
share it with me.

A Mother´s Report: 2-CB
</h3>

<p>
 It had been some months since my 19 year old son 
and I had been together; he is establishing a life for 
himself in Washington state, and his visit was a gift. We 
talked and visited in the usual ways, catching up on 
news and projects and meeting friends.
 A woman friend of mine was also visiting for a few 
days, and invited us to share in a treasured evening 
with some 2-CB she had had for some time. I invited 
my son along for the experience- we had never shared 
any hallucinogens, though he had taken LSD with 
friends in high school and had told me later of the 
experience.
</p>
<p>
 My own history with psychedelics is varied- first 
sampling mescaline in college and trying LSD and 
MDMA in subsequent years. I had discontinued use of 
hallucinogens some years ago; feeling complete in 
some ways and disappointed in others. The LSD 
experiences I´d had led to more ego bashing than I felt 
comfortable with even though hallucinogens had 
opened up my inner eyes help to create the 
perspective that I currently maintained on the world. I 
shared trips with friends and my brother in my teens 
and twenties in the spirit of growth and exploration. 
When Ecstasy came into my circle of friends, I tried it, 
recognizing the blissful state of MDMA from years 
earlier. I enjoyed the connection with friends and my 
internal world, but unfounded rumors of liver toxicity 
lead me to downplay further exploration.
</p>
<p>
 Encouraged by my friend´s previous experiences, I 
went forward by intuition into the 2-CB experience 
with my son. 2-CB is a gentle friend- colorful internal 
journeys are possible with closed eyes. A delightful 
sensuality plays over the skin and the sense of body is 
heightened. We spent hours in a hot tub floating in a 
waking dream, a completely nurturing environment. 
The gentle clarity and loving acceptance that i felt was 
deeply satisfying. I surrendered into an essential 
embrace of unconditional love. I felt it for my friends 
with whom I shared the experience and for my son. We 
had the stars for our ceiling and a small need for words 
as barometers for our individual states.
</p>
<p>
 At a midway point my son chose to leave the tub and 
go to another part of the property on his own. I 
profoundly entered into the letting go aspect of my 
parenting, allowing his choice of direction and 
environment. I experienced random visions of him 
estranged, alone, an incomplete form. I also felt a 
soothing acceptance of his growth, his direction, his 
individuality.
</p>
<p>
 I so enjoyed my time with my son and my friends that 
I can hardly imagine a more perfect experience. More 
importantly, I feel more comfortable within myself 
about the natural process of my child´s growing 
independence, which though inevitable, leaves a 
tearing sense of loss without some deep internal 
reflection.
</p>
<p>
 Sharing a vision of from an altered perspective gave 
my son and I an opportunity for closeness and 
communion that I haven´t felt within the normal day to 
day living that we shared for so many years. The ability 
to perceive him as unique in the moment helps me to 
honor his separateness and simultaneously appreciate 
our commonality.
