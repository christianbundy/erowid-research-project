24-year old male.<br>
I have somewhat extensive experience with psychedelic drugs over the past few years, including mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, 5-MeO-DMT, mescaline, DMT, salvia, DXM.<br>
I have tried 5-MeO-DIPT twice before, at 5mg and 8mg (5mg alone and 8mg with my girlfriend).<br><br>
The purpose of this trip was to introduce a friend B to psychedelics, about which he has been curious for a while. Another friend H has tripped before, but trips less frequently than I do. I am in a fairly positive mindset: there have been stresses in my life recently (when are there not?) but I am not thinking about them today and I am excited to trip with two good friends who I havent tripped with before.  At around 3pm one Sunday afternoon, Bs introductory psychedelic experience consisted of 2.5g mushrooms, while H and I each took 10mg 5-MeO-DIPT.  I had been tripping alone recently, and I found tripping with friends to be so different than tripping by myself, especially when you have to be something of a guide or sitter. Because of their presence I didn't let myself feel the full effects of the drug until the trip had stabilized. <br><br>
T+0:15 - I felt first alerts<br><br>
T+1:00-1:30 - I fully let it all in, realizing I was at a solid ++ and feeling the characteristic body energy I tend to feel on this drug.  Personally, I find the body high mostly enjoyable; today it is very relaxing and stimulating at the same time, feeling almost like a full body orgasm with energy trying to explode from every cell.  Thoughts are sort of scattered and flighty, almost caffeine-like.  <br><br>
T+1:30 - More psychedelic mental effects begin to materialize and vie with the body energy for my attention, and we decide to go outside for a walk. I live in the city, but fortunately is a particularly green and friendly part of the city. It is cloudy, but warm enough to be pleasant and spring is in full bloom. Everything looks so lush, green, and beautiful; especially after such a long ugly winter. We make our way to a small park in front of a public library and sit under a willow tree and talk philosophically for about an hour. I am convinced that mankind's technology must be used to slow our lives down; that we have reached a point where everybody doesn't have to work 40 hours a week at shitty jobs just to survive. Let's mechanize things, cut out the unimportant work, and foster cultural values of free time, beauty, and art.  We need to be free to pursue the things that inspire us, not just what is needed to pay for all our material possessions.  My tripping companions are of a different viewpoint, that competition and technology fuel great things and we should see where this giant machine we've spawned will go. I am somewhat saddened by their thoughts but at the same time I realize my views are quite at odds with society at large and I can't going around being upset at everyone for feeling differently. Resentment doesn't help my cause and I would be better off being more accepting. At this point the psychedelic effects of the drug are peaking, and while the body energy is still apparent but is nowhere near as dominant as earlier in the experience. I see some minor OEVs, mostly in the form of changing and pulsating light levels (almost stroboscopic), and some patterning around the peripheries of vision. Colors are enhanced and I am struck by the beauty of my environment. <br><br>
T+3:00 - We begin to walk the 1/2 mile or so back to my apartment. Even though I am peaking at a relatively strong ++, I am amazed at how functional I am. I feel perfectly comfortable walking down the street, finding my way around, and interacting with people if need be. I don't think I would be able to do this on a comparable dose of mushrooms for example. Once we get home we listen to a couple CDs: Radiohead - Kid A, The Books - Food For Thought, and the band I play in (which was a curious and enlightening experience). I am having a thoroughly great time, feeling a lot of connection and compassion for my fellow trippers. Despite my role as a guide, I am considerably higher than either of my companions: H is somewhat of a hardhead and didnt feel the 5-MeO-DIPT as strongly as I, and Bs first dose of mushrooms was apparently a little low and he compared the effects to a good pot brownie.  <br><br>
T+5:00 - I continue to be at a ++; we decide to drive over to a friend's ice cream store. I would prefer not to bring cars into the experience at this point, but H assures me that he's perfectly fine by now.  I continue to feel effects for another couple of hours.<br><br>
T+9:00 - I attempt to sleep.  It is somewhat unsuccessful as my mind is still busy from the day's events (I'm probably still at a +), and its not until at least T+12 that I am fully able to rest. <br><br>
In retrospect, based on my three (admittedly somewhat low dosage) experiences with 5-MeO-DIPT, I feel I am able to make some broad generalizations about how I experience the drug.  I would say that the drug's effects could be separated into two distinct phases. The first effect is the body energy that is fairly typical of everyone I've known to have taken the drug. It usually begins quickly (within 15-30 minutes), and lasts 2 hours or more before gradually tapering off by 5 or 6 hours. Around the 1:30-2 hour point the psychedelic effects, which have been present only around the edges of the experience up until then, begin to manifest themselves. The psychedelic high is very clear, with little of the mental confusion I find with mushrooms. Visuals are at least as apparent as a mushroom trip of the same intensity level, and intuitive leaps as well as feelings of interpersonal connectedness are also quite apparent. The psychedelic high lasts a bit longer than the body high, for me often not subsiding until 8 hours or more, after which sleep tends to be difficult.  I my opinion it would be a much more useful drug without the body energy, which is mildly pleasant at best and downright distracting at worst. At low doses (5mg) the body energy dominates the experience, which leaves a lovely empathic afterglow after 2-3 hours. At higher doses (8 and 10mg), the psychedelic portion is intensified and blends with the body part to an increasing degree. I would imagine higher doses would further expand on the psychedelic part, but I also imagine the body load would begin to be overbearing. As a catalyst of emotional connections at low doses, this is an amazing drug. However, I think I'm done experimenting.<!-- End Body -->
