Previous experience: Loads of alcohol &amp; cannabis<br><br><br>
The very first time I took HBWR seeds, I wanted to avoid the nausea.<br>
I didn't eat for 6-7 hours. I removed the light-brownish husks with<br>
nails and a knife. I chew 4 seeds for 15 minutes and then I spitted<br>
everything out. It didn't work so well. In one particular moment I<br>
felt like I was totally numb and later on I felt like I was going<br>
to fell asleep. I also smoked some hashish because I didn't really<br>
believe the seeds we're working. And while I was doing this I drank<br>
couple of beers. I usually drink &amp; smoke alot, but this time I was<br>
so tired after all this shit I just wanted to get some sleep. I<br>
can't truly tell if I was intoxicated by the seeds or not.<br><br>
The next morning, I prepared for the nausea. First I removed once<br>
again carefully the light-brownish husks from the seeds. Then I<br>
ground up 6 seeds in 3 different cups, each holding 2 seeds.<br>
I boiled some mineral water, let it cool down to 60 celsius and<br>
added that into every cup. I waited for 2-3 hours for the mixtures<br>
to cool down into room temperature. I also didn't eat anything for<br>
4 hours. Just 10 minutes before I started to ingest the actual<br>
mixture, I ate a teaspoonfull of ginger. Some people claim it<br>
helps avoiding the nausea. The taste of ginger is not so pleasant.<br>
It burns all the way down my throat and into my stomach.<br><br>
After the 'ginger hell' I drank 2 cups of my mixture, so I had<br>
ingested total of 4 seeds. After 15-20 minutes, I started to feel<br>
light-headed. I had to resist the vomiting. Ginger was still burning<br>
and the seeds really did make me wanna throw up. I knew I had to.<br>
Still, I resisted. It was quite difficult to relax or to walk, I<br>
felt like I was a bit drunk and I wanted to vomit. I decided to wait<br>
for 60 minutes, and then I would throw up if I had to. Right after<br>
this I realized, I could control my feelings quite well. I could<br>
sing along with some piece of music and forget the urge for vomiting.<br>
I believed I could control these kind of feelings, I believed it was<br>
all in my head. I carefully chose good songs to make me feel better.<br>
And it did. I also did some things I really like, playing guitar,<br>
singing &amp; such. All these things made me feel even better. Then<br>
suddenly, I remembered last night, and I recalled I had feelings<br>
quite like this, and I enjoyed it.<br><br>
The only downside, besides the urge for vomiting, was the feeling<br>
of drowsyness... I even made some coffee just to keep me awake.<br>
Then I wanted to drink the last cup of 2 seeds mixture I made earlier.<br>
I drank it and went to see my friend. I still felt like I was only a bit<br>
drunk. When I reached my friends residence, we watched a video and smoked<br>
some cannabis. I told my friend what I had done and he didn't seem to care,<br>
I felt like I had no-one to tell this.<br><br>
Then, from out of nowhere, appeared a new world in front of me.<br>
I started to realize things from a totally new perspective.<br>
I knew I had to leave immediately. The information that kept<br>
coming from things I did there was too much. I told my friend<br>
I couldn't concentrate for what we we're doing because I was<br>
somewhere else, doing something else. And then I left.<br><br>
When I was walking back home, I saw a group of people who were<br>
sitting in a bar nearby. They all arose and left the bar as soon<br>
as I walked by. At first, I thought to myself, am I that horrible?<br>
Then I realized they split up because they were going somewhere else.<br>
It was the relief of my life. And as I continued walking back home,<br>
I saw some elderly people as well, they looked at me and I swear,<br>
I knew exactly what they were thinking. So I reacted differently,<br>
and I saw how it affected them. I believed I could control this<br>
situation. It was all just a matter of understanding gestures.<br>
And those gestures had always been there for me. But only now, I could<br>
understand those gestures so well that I could control the situation.<br>
I was quite polite and I enjoyed it. And it made me feel good too.<br><br>
When I got back home, I saw my entire life like a book. It was all<br>
there. I just never realized it, because it didn't have any meaning.<br>
By looking any object I own, I saw where it had come from, why it<br>
was there, why I liked it and why I chose to keep it. I remembered<br>
all the things it had been through, where was it made, who had played<br>
with it and so on... In my everyday life, I pass by many things<br>
I have gathered throughout my years of existence like it didn't<br>
mean anything to me. Well it does. I just never stop there to<br>
see and understand the meaning of it all. But this time I could see.<br>
I was so overwhelmingly happy of all the objects I had received from<br>
thousands of different sources it made me smile. It made me cherish<br>
life itself.<br><br>
Then I got an another idea. I wanted to record a video of myself<br>
thinking these kinds of things. In case I would forget how happy I was.<br>
It was a difficult task. I had to remind myself of what I was doing<br>
for every 5 seconds. I just saw the camera and I remembered every little<br>
recording the camera had ever recorded and every little detail of the<br>
camera made me remember where it was damaged and so on... When I finally<br>
managed to assemble it, I started recording. It was impossible to speak<br>
those things which were inside my head. It was all too much. When I<br>
opened my mouth and said something, my mouth froze and I was left<br>
speechless, dreaming. Every sentence I started, ended prematurely as<br>
my mind drifted away with the memories I encountered everywhere I gazed<br>
upon. This is when I decided not to record anymore.<br><br>
I went to my bed to lie down and enjoy. I have no idea how long I was<br>
there, since time had no meaning at all. Or at least, I didn't care.<br>
The rest of my trip I embraced life and tried to focus my thoughts<br>
to gain understanding of life. And I did understand. The trip<br>
was over in about 6 hours or so, and I started to feel the after<br>
effects. I called my friend to come see me and apologized why<br>
I was so rude earlier. He said he understanded why I did it, and<br>
I understanded it too. We smoked some pot, watched some videos and<br>
had a great time. Afterwards we just fell asleep.<br><br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
At the first time, I didn't take enough seeds and my technique was<br>
totally incorrect. The next time I drank the seed mixtures I was<br>
successful and had just the right amount. I had some slight visuals<br>
too, not worth mentioning though. The inner adventure I had was so<br>
much more. I still feel happy about my journey, and I believe my<br>
journey was successful because my timing was right. My life was so<br>
perfect at the time it reflected my trip very pleasantly. Also I would<br>
like to point out the side-effects I had, the terrible nausea at first<br>
and the hangover which included 'foggy' mind, thirst and numb legs.<br>
Still, it was the price to pay and I will certainly do this again.<!-- End Body -->
