 "report": "<p>I took 3mg of melatonin daily for eight years. At first it was to help me sleep better; then it was just to sleep.  I was hooked. I tried getting off it six or seven times,but always felt like crap after a week, and had to go back on.  Finally I managed to get</p><p>off and stay off by using diphenhydramine(in the form of Tylenol PM) for a week.  For some reason, the benadryl wasn't as habit-forming as the melatonin.  I've been off for a couple months now, and although I'm still sleepier than I used to be, and don't have the sharp memory I used to, at least I'm not making things worse by staying on a drug I don't need.</p>"
