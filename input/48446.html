First off, it all started one day when I found an old bottle of Vicodin hp(10/500). I had had a very bad day and a really bad headache, so I decided to try a prescription strength painkiller. Ibuprofen and Aceta werent working anymore. And at this time, I was about 19, I had no care in the world for prescription painkillers, none at all, I always thought they were drugs old bored housewives abused. <br><br>
Anyways I took 2 of the Vicodin and about a half-hour later I felt like I was in heaven. All I could do was stretch and lay and relax, all pain was gone, including my depression. Completely gone! It was amazing! Every thought, everything I saw was amazing, it was euphoric. <br><br>
So I downed the rest of the bottle over about a weeks period, and was sad because I figured id never see them again. I was wrong. <br><br>
A month later my best friend injured himself at work and was prescribed Norco-thats 10mgs of hydro and 325 of acetaminophen. He gave me a few at first and those same old feelings I grew to love a month ago returned. he ended up liking them too. For pain and psychological reasons. So he had a steady supply of Norco each month, getting at least 120 of them. Well hes the type of guy that likes to make money, I mean he had been selling grass his whole life of, now he discovered these beauties. so each day id go over to his house, hed all ready be doped up, id buy a few, 5 bucks a pill, fucking rip off, but I didnt care, I needed the depression relief. This went on for about a year and during that year he and I met some people who also enjoyed the wonderful opioids. Thats when I discovered Percocet, Oxycontin, both containing Oxycodone, then MS Contin, then Demerol, and then the big one -Fentanyl- I had tried Darvocet before but that shit is so weak, and all it does is make me depressed. anyways I was doing Norco or Lorcet, Oxycodone, and wearing a goddamn 75mcg fentanyl patch, all at the same time, and all within a year.<br><br>
So another year goes by. I know have to take at least 70mgs of Hydrocodone, at this point in time, just to get a buzz, it then turned to shooting up Oxycontin and MS-Contin, Id have 100mcg Fentanyl patches on for weeks at a time. after two days with one, Id slap another... and so on. This whole time I was using these drugs as antidepressants, and of course to get high.<br><br>
It never stopped, it was nothing but thinking about the drugs. I was rude and irritable between doses, I was lying to my beloved family, and worst of all, I had no more musical creativity whatsoever. (I had produced and sold loops and tracks, even scored a few independent film projects. I was a true junky. Opioids became me and vice versa. <br><br>
So the use continued for another couple of years, this time I would take (seriously) 100mgs of hydro, right when id wake up - then go hang out with my friends and do 2 full 80mg oxycontin lines, or one 80 mg oxy injection. Then by bedtime, id down some more hydro, or chew on a 40mg oxycontin. I was completely out of control. and I was flirting with death and didnt even care. I had no more interests. I had lost a lot of good friends, and the tolerance was higher than ever. <br><br>
Well, the suppliers all left town one-by-one until there was no way of getting my drugs anymore. this was bad. I remember my first experience with opioid withdrawal, and ill never ever forget it. I had 20 10/500s left that I reserved, knowing that I would no longer have access because the dealers had all left unexpectedly. I tried to wean off, but with hydrocodone-I had to eat 12 that day, then the remainder the next day. Then cold turkey. here is what happened. <br><br>
I woke up from a horrible nightmare, my entire body feeling like it was being ripped apart, I felt like I had mono again, and my stomach felt like a torch was inside of it. I ran to the bathroom and puked and shit all over myself, this went on for 2 weeks. I slept only about 2 hours a night, the depression was overbearing, I mean I hit rock bottom, and everything I had done wrong while I was on the drugs came back to haunt me. Almost to the point of psychosis. I was miserable, all I could think about was the drugs and my bad behavior that left me with nothing.<br><br>
Currently Im still recovering. its been a good 3 months since I last put the drugs into my mind and body, and I feel more depressed now than before. I ended up having to tell my whole family what I had been doing, I tried to reconcile with my old best friends, but they didnt really respond. I went to a psychiatrist, Im trying the antidepressant Remeron and it only sort of eases the depression. I look like a zombie, I feel like one, and I wish I would have never taken those horrible drugs. but fuck, Id do them in a heartbeat again if given the chance.<!-- End Body -->
