 "report": "<p>Myself: Caucasian college aged male, 60 and 135 lbs</p><p>Drug History: Cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, LSA, 5-meo-dipt,salvia, cocaine, alprazolam, zolpidem,  gabapentin, and amphetamines.</p><p>Set and Setting: I had just recently moved in to a new apartment with a long time friend, D. Classes had not yet started and we wanted to trip in our new apartment. About two months prior, I had bought what was sold to me as 20 mg of 2c-e and D had bought 5-meo-dipt.</p><p>Experience:</p><p>On the day of the planned trip, we both consumed our drugs at about noon. I ate my gelcap and D opened his up, dissolved the powder into a shot of whiskey and drank it. A short while later, D reported being nauseous and went to the bathroom to vomit, which he ended up doing once more. At this point, he reported that he was tripping quite hard. I, on the other hand, felt next to nothing. I only had a bit of the excited feeling I usually get when I am coming up on psychedelics. We then smoked some cannabis together, which synergized nicely with the subtle effects of the drug. After finishing the cannabis, we decided to go to a nearby zoo. It has now been about 1.5 to 2 hours since I ingested the drug and I am still only feeling subtle effects. I have given up on the thought of tripping, assuming that the drug had degraded in the months that it had been in storage. I am, however, still in a positive mood and enjoy looking at the animals.</p><p>[T+ 2:30] We are now in the Herpetarium looking at various reptiles and amphibians. While looking at one of the animals, I suddenly feel as if I have been given a slap across the face by the chemical. I am tripping, and hard. I wasnt tripping an unmanageable amount, but it was, nonetheless, pretty strong. We continue to make the rounds at the zoo. The animals have seemingly taken on a new level of awesome. Once we have finished looking at the animals, we decide that its time to go back to the apartment.</p><p>[T+ 4:00] We finally made it back to the apartment. On the way, I had started to trip a bit harder and I had started to feel a body load. As soon as we got in, I found a comfortable blanket and collapsed on the couch. I continued to trip harder and harder until I got to the point where I had lost almost all connection to reality. My memory of this time period is a bit fuzzy. My mind was racing and I started thinking of some fairly strange and, at points, delusional thoughts. I questioned for a while whether I would even be going back to reality. I remember for a short period considering the possibility that I had been taken over by a chemical that was going to force me to take more and more of it, never to return to the life I had once had. I went to get a drink of water at some point and noticed strong open eyed visuals. There were very strong and clearly defined tracers on anything that moved, and, looking out the window, the treetops had become a collection of swirling and morphing patterns.</p><p>[T+ 7:30] After about 3.5 hours of being bed-ridden because of tripping so hard, I was finally able to pull it together enough to be able to assess my situation. D was gone and I was now alone. My phone had a text on it from a friend, J, who wanted to hang out. I texted him back and he came over. We smoked several bowls of cannabis and talked while I tried to regain composure. He left after a little while, leaving me alone again. I was still tripping a moderate amount and spent the rest of the night doing various things around the apartment.</p><p>[T+ 11:00] I am exhausted from the day of tripping and try to go to sleep. The effects have tapered a little, but I am still definitely tripping and I quickly realize that sleep isnt going to happen anytime soon. I get up and do my best to kill some time.</p><p>[T+ 14:30] After many efforts, I am finally able to go to sleep. The effects of the drug had still not completely worn off at this point.</p><p>Final Thoughts: This was most definitely not 2c-e. My experience exactly fits the description of a 2c-p trip, so I am fairly sure that that is what I consumed. This was my first phenethylamine, and it was quite the introduction. I dont think Ill go back to 2c-p anytime soon, but I dont regret the experience and I am eager to try other 2cs. I also have learned my lesson with trusting dealers with research chemicals. From now on I will be ordering from trusted online vendors only.</p>"
