 "report": "<p>I snorted half a pill, Im sorry I dont know how many milligrams it was, at around 2pm.  The feeling was good, although nothing too intense.  However, between 6 and 7pm I smoked some pot.  Immediately I became very hot and had to step outside.  Sitting outside in the 15 degree temperature, still very warm, I began halucitating.  The visuals were very similar to a mushroom trip.  </p><p>I then managed to climb up some stairs on my college campus. However, I fell down these stairs and lostcontrol over my body.  My mind was still present and I was aware I was falling.  I came to having fallen down half the set of stairs, only to black out again and fall down the rest.  </p><p>I was more than pleased with what the drug had done to me, namely because of its intensity and I began to come down around 9 or 10 pm.  However, the next day, I woke up with a rash on the undersides of my arms.  The rash only increased in the coming days.  It appeared on my midsection and slowing migrated up my chest and neck.  I also had the rash on the palms of my hands and the soles of my feet.  Showering burned intensly.</p><p>The rash was bad, but I also experienced serious respatory difficulty.  I couldnt walk up stairs without being seriously out of breath.  I would need to rest while standing in front of the refrigerator picking out something to eat.  Eating also was not something I was able to do for a very long time. </p><p>More than a week later, with the rash still going strong and the respitory problems continuing, I ended up going to the doctor.  She told me I had an extraordinarily enlarged spleen, that I would need to be put on steroids and that I was lucky I didnt die from taking the morphine.  The steroids reduced the rash and breathing difficulty and got my appetite back.  Two weeks after taking the morphine, the rash was gone.</p><p>Oddly enough, I had taken codeine and I have smoked lots of opium since that time and have experienced no side effects.  I have been told that I may have been alergic to whatever else was in the pill, however, all of the symptoms I displayed were similar to allergic reaction to morphine.  Be careful.</p>"
