 "report": "<p>So every weekend I  smoke a bunch of weed with my friend Jordon. I have a big house, and its easy to smoke in my room when my dad falls asleep. So one weekend, I had two other friends come up and smoke, one brought about 2-3 grams of hydro, and me and Jordon had 3 grams in Indoor KB. After smoking a good 80% of all of it, I took the biggest hit of my life. The weed cought on fire, the flame was pretty big. I got the whole bowl down in one hit, and then my whole body went numb. Then things went hazy. </p><p>The next thing i knew, I was around seven feet tall, wearing a plaid brown suit, and I had a beard and hair down to my knees. I hate on big glasses, and i was being interveiwed on CNN becaus ei had discovered fossil fuel. I was interviewed for a good hour and a half, answering a bunch of questions and drawing up graphs. My friends said that during that entire time, I was speaking in complete jibberish. I either was saying random words and numbers, or just making strange noises.</p>"
