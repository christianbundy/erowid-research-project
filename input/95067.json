 "report": "<p>Now, Ive taken this drug once before (in the same format, a swallowed pill) and had an ace day. However, this time I thought I could keep a log of how I felt. The following is a combination of that log and a couple of additions from memory.</p><p>10.45: MXE taken. I go downstairs with my girlfriend (E) and turn on my xbox.</p><p>10.56: Extremities buzzing slightly. Cant feel my toes. </p><p>10.59: Head rush.</p><p>11.01: Edges are beginning to seem more defined. I have a slight feeling of disassociation with my body. Slightly harder to write.</p><p>11.05: Start playing a game. My friend (N) comes onto xbox Live and we discuss playing co-operatively on something else later. N then leaves to eat.</p><p>11.15: I switch to the suggested game and begin to play. I feel much more like I am IN the game  an intense and enjoyable experience!</p><p>11.20: VERY strong headrush and a feeling of being pulled through.</p><p>11.29: Im still here. N comes online and we attempt to set up a party. I find it difficult to speak, but tell him why. He is very unimpressed.</p><p>11.44: N leaves in disgust. I continue to spin around in circles and fire at random things. E stops me and suggests a cup of tea.</p><p>11.47: Tea is nice. Its warmth is lifegiving and pure.</p><p>11.48: Things ripple lazily around me, but apparently I laugh at the thought of suppressing it with my iron will (or so I said according to E).</p><p>11.51: Can feel myself falling out of it. </p><p>12.05: Come to. Go upstairs with difficulty and sit down in my chair.</p><p>12.15: Still here, but difficult to write.</p><p>12.17: From here until 12.27 I wander my memories. I focus particularly on one: a salvia trip that left me with the feeling that I was meant to try something stronger. I consider my recollections of Ayahuasca reports. Several of them mentioned that they felt called to it. I feel uneasy and convince myself that I was not meant to be a shaman in any way, though the idea remains.</p><p>12.27: I return to real life to find things rippling. When the visuals stop, I put on some music and start to read a manga series online. I am drawn into the story, with the monsters seeming all too realistic.</p><p>12.36: Enjoying music very much. E asks if I want to come and sit in the bed. I spontaneously take off all my clothes, feeling comfortable and unashamed of myself. I lie down and close my eyes. Immediately I am taken somewhere else. Time seems to stop, and my lonely sense of identity struggles to maintain itself as it travels the void. I feel myself being pulled back, but not before I get the feeling that I am attempting something with the wrong equipment. I look at E, and can see around her head her fears and worries. Most worrying though is the large black entity that I am sure is her mental instabilities (she has slight schizophrenic issues). I push my willpower into it and see it move. I know that there is nothing I can do about it. </p><p>13.36: Get up to go to the bathroom. I feel cleansed, and sit back down in my chair. I think about the idea of alchemys equivalent exchange. It seems sensible and realistic. I put on Spoonman by Underworld.</p><p>13.46: E falls asleep.</p><p>13.51: The mouse is becoming very hard to move.</p><p>14.00: E wakes up, and we decide to go and have a smoke in the bathroom. The bowl on my bong is enormous, and we end up having a good 6 hits each off it. We stand around in the bathroom for a bit, and I attempt to tell E about the feeling that I could be a shaman.</p><p>14.27: Sit down at my desk again. Colours seem more vibrant and flashy.</p><p>14.30: Put on Dracul by Infected Mushroom and remember that Im going to see them that night, but at some point I need to get on a train to London.</p><p>14.55: Notice E is missing, and hope she hasnt heard me talking to what I thought was her.</p><p>15.10: I put on my dressing gown, and E comes in reminding me that Ive got about an hour before we need to go. </p><p>15.37-15.48: I have a shower. The water feels, smells and tastes metallic (but not in a bad way) and I get out feeling very refreshed and much more clear-headed. </p><p>16.00: I have a shave, and look in the mirror to see my face looking much more goat-like than I remembered. No, more as if I have a connection with goats and their natural characteristics.</p><p>16.10: Leave for the station.</p><p>After this the effects definitely wore off, though I was left feeling euphoric for a couple more hours. I didnt feel any sort of a comedown (though this could be due to the excitement I felt about going to see Infected Mushroom!). All in all I found this to be a great drug, but it did prevent me from doing anything for a couple of hours</p>"
