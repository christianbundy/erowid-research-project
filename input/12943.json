 "report": "<p>Tried it by myself one evening after work.  Smoked it in a water pipe by the prescribed method that was suggested.  I did not have a sober partner at the time.  I got into a relaxed mood and took a small hit then bigger one holding it for 45 seconds.  Didn't think I held it long enough and took one more small one.  First of all am I the only one that thinks it taste like a strong black tea.</p><p>When I went to put the pipe down I was now in a new reality.  I kept thinking a group of people were telling me what to do and go.  The room seemed to have blinking lights.  I had to walk a bit to my bed to lay down.  Hardest thing I have ever done.</p><p>It only took 2 minutes to get an effect.  While laying down I kept wondering between a spanish casa to a jungle hut.  I think I was having a conversation in spanish and I only talk english.  </p><p>The trip lasted a good half an hour with a nice calm for about an hour with no headache.  Also I had no shortness of breath or paranoia.  Something I will be sharing with others.  I think though if I do this with a group that one person should be sober for those that are not as calm.  May want to try this in a hot tub.</p>"
