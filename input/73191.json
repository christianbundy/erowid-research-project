 "report": "<p>Greetings to all fellow students of the teacher plant matrix,</p><p>I received an ounce of dried Sunicuichi leaves, flowers and stems through mail order, as I'm always on the lookout for plant teachers that I have yet to experience. Sinichuichi is touted as the 'Mayan Sun Opener', and R. Gordon Wasson identified the flower on the statue of Xochipilli, the Aztec God of Flowers, along with the mushroom, morning glory, and tobacco plants, so I figured I would be in good company with those Spirits.</p><p>I prepared my first dose as a tea. When I woke up in the morning (about 8ish) I boiled roughly 14 grams (half my bag of an ounce) in 2 cups of water, with a few mint leaves thrown in to help with the taste, as I have read that is is very bitter. I boiled that down until it was just under a cup, strained the leaves and set the liquid aside. Put the leaves back in the pot with another 2 cups of fresh water, which I boiled down to less then a cup, then added the original liquid, and finally reduced it to little less than a cup. Then I put everything in a glass jar, along with a Tazo Sweet Orange teabag, and took it outside, as I have read that it should be steeped in the sun for a day before drinking. Unlucky for me that day was overcast, so it sat in the jar on the porch until noon the next day, when the sun finally made it's appearance. I let it sit in the sun until it went down that night, then brought it in and put it in the fridge (don't ask me why I put it there, perhaps I thought it would 'go bad'?).</p><p>As I write this, it is the next day. I could not sleep last night, so I just stayed up and searched the net. At about 6:30am I went into the kitchen to start my day. I normally go down to the creek every other morning for meditation, so I thought it would be a good day to drink the Sinicuichi and go out into nature. I took the jar from the fridge, and put it back on the stove and boiled it down to roughly little more than half a cup. I suggest if you wish to try it as a tea to boil it down even further, as the reports about it being bitter are understated. It is VERY bitter, even with the extra mint leaves and orange teabag. So, I put a couple of heaping tablespoons of sugar to quell the taste, then it was bearable. I took it down in about a half dozen gulps, and even before the last drop went down, my arms started to feel heavy.</p><p>So, I went down to the creek and tried to meditate, with little success. Perhaps it was because I was up all night, so now my body wanted to rest, or, oh, I forgot to mention that I had nothing to eat for about 10 hours prior to ingesting the Sinicuichi, so my stomach was a little restless. After being there for 10 minutes or so, I started to notice the audible change that I read about, or perhaps it was projected due to what I read. Sounds seemed to come from closer than they actually were, and I was hearing little squeaks and chirps that didn't sound like any birds I ever heard before. I sat there with my eyes closed for a while, and when I opened them, I did notice a slight yellowish-orange after image on some of the tree tops, near where the sun was rising up from behind me and shining on them, but I did not notice it anywhere else. I felt that I couldn't meditate properly and so I decided to lay on my back and look up at the sky. Apparently I started drifting in and out of consciousness, so I decided to head back home, as I felt physically beat. My mood was fairly bright, and I felt good mentally, but it wasn't like ecstasy or anything LOL. </p><p>So I went home and almost immediately passed out on my bed. That was at about 8am. Around 11 I woke up and felt every muscle in my body aching, but I was so tired that I didn't care and passed back out. I woke up fully about an hour ago (it is now 4pm), and when I woke up I felt like a herd of buffalo had trampled me. The reports of muscle soreness are vastly understated. EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY ACHED...even my finger and toe joints, and my scalp too. My stomach felt like it was kicked repeatedly, or as if I did some intense sit up session the day before...it REALLY hurt. I know I'm not in the best shape I could be, but I do jog a few times a week and lift free weights when I can, but it seems to me that the Aztecs and Mayans probably had NO PROBLEM with Sinicuichi, because they were for the most part perfect physical specimens...I guess you had to be when hunting down jaguars and such ;) I know I will try smoking it next time for sure.</p><p>When I got up, I just felt stuck to the bed, but I forced myself to get up because the stomach cramps were tremendous. Went to the bathroom, and let me tell you, the reports of Sinicuichi causing diarrhea aren't false...everything I ate the day before came out in one titanic flush. BUT, after that, I went back to the bed, and my girlfriend brought me an apple and some ibuprofen (I really hate doing pharmaceuticals, but sometimes it helps), so now I'm not as bad as I was...my upper body soreness is starting to subside, my calves are still aching, probably because I haven't walked around much yet, and my stomach is only dully aching at this point, or more so when I breathe really deep ;).</p><p>So thats about it..nothing spectacular as far as an entheogenic experience is concerned, just pain. Perhaps the tea needs to be steeped for more than a few days in the sun, to kill off any bad micro organisms in the mix. I'm sure smoking might prove to be more fruitful, so that's what I'll try next with the remainder of my ounce. Maybe I'll try an extraction with alcohol with the last 1/4 ounce, who knows. I hope this account helped you for whatever intents and purposes.</p><p>I think I'm going to go for a walk now...</p><p>OneLove,</p><p> Tryp   -=0]</p>"
