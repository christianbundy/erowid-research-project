 "report": "<p>I have been trying to get access to decent mugwort for some time now and have recently acquired a full pound of it over the Internet. Although I only kept half as it was co-payed for by a friend. The night I got it I smoked two bowls of it in my pipe.  I was expecting very little, but instead was surprised when a very noticeable wave of something came over me almost immediately.</p><p>It really is hard to explain what that something was... a sense of serenity and almost epiphany-like calm would be the best way to describe it. All in all, to quote my friend who also has used it with similar success, if it were a little more potent, it would defiantly be preferable to marijuana.  </p><p>The smoke is pretty smooth. First time I took it, it was with a straight pipe and it was just a little bit too harsh for my liking, but after that I used a water bong that solved the harshness problem. On it's own, it smells something similar to tea, once smoked it has a strong sent that could be easily mistaken for marijuana. </p><p>After I finished smoking it, I went back inside and chilled for about a half-hour, wallowing in this generalized good feeling. then I went to bed and just layed awake for about 15 minutes. One odd thing that I noticed is that it was very easy for me to visualize things in my head. That is, I could see, quite vividly, objects in my minds eye. And so eventually a fell asleep. I'm not even going to bother to try and convey the dream experiences I had. Utterly unlike any that I have had before it. The next morning I woke up feeling perhaps a little out of it (likely from the insane dreams I had been having all night) but otherwise completely refreshed and feeling more alive than I had been for quite some time. A certain weight that seemed to have been on me for quite a while seemed to have been lifted, I felt energized, and particularly clear minded.</p><p>Since then (1.5 weeks ago) I have had at least one bowl pretty much every night, I have found myself to be sleeping better, and feeling better throughout the day. I wholeheartedly recommend this to every person wanted to explore the dream world, or for anyone that just wants a mellow alternative to tobacco or marijuana.</p>"
