 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nYesterday I was very bored and home alone. I didn't have any marijuana so I started reading user experiences here on erowid, I came across codeine.. I knew I had some aspirin or something with codeine somewhere in the house so I did the seperation trick with hot water, cooled the water and filtered the solution into a glass and drank it.. it wasn't that bad of a taste more bitter than sour, but I wouldn't drink it regularly. I went upstairs and started reading more user experiences on erowid.<br>I started feeling light headed and kind of tired about 30 minutes later. The strange part about the tiredness is that I would close my eyes and my eye lids would shake until I opened them again. I soon started feeling extremely relaxed, like I could sit in my chair for days on end, I did stuff on my computer, listened to music.. played games.. nothing was really spectacular visually or audibally, but I was so comfortable just sitting there it was unbelievable.<br>I went downstairs to get a drink and as I was leaving the kitched I turned off the light, at that point I was extremely scared, I had to run upstairs. <br>I soon went to lay down, this is where it got strange. I couldn't sleep, I was just relaxed and thinking about stuff.. I kept hearing noises from downstairs (real, every day house creeks.. wasn't hearing things :)) at this point I was VERY scared and it was hard to take my mind off it, that kept going on for an hour or two when finally I passed out.<br>All in all I had a wonderful time on the codeine, I've never felt more relaxed.. I'm writing this the day after the experience and I feel fine.. still generally relaxed and somewhat tired.. no headache or bad side effects.. I did have a MINOR stomach ache earlier but a bit of pepto-bismal fixed that right up..<br>I recommend codeine for relaxing and every once and awhile.<br>With all drugs though, watch how much you take.. start off somewhat low. I took just enough to feel good and have no side effects, I'll probably try increasing the dose sometime soon..<br>Positive effects<br>----------------<br>Relaxation<br>Great comfort<br>Neutral effects<br>---------------<br>None? :)<br>Negative effects<br>----------------<br>Paranoia<br>Somewhat hard to go to sleep when I wanted<br>Minor stomach ache<br>Hard time concentrating (Out of curiousity I tried doing simple math equations in my head [8x12] and found I could hardly concentrate enough to do them)\n\n\n"
