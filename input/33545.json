 "report": "<p>Okay so this is how it goes...</p><p>I am a senior in college right now at Southern Illinois University, a pretty big party school, (have been a party animal my whole life), feel like reflecting on an experience that I had the summer before freshman year of high school.  </p><p>I lived near Orlando, Florida at the time.  Down there there during the summer it rains all the time.  So naturally, shrooms grow in the cow feilds on piles of sh#%.  You find them early in the morning just growing everywhere.  But you have to know the right ones because there are some that will kill you right away.  I had some friends that tought me the ropes.  They were combinations of brown/purple on top and purple underneath, had a white stem, and a purple ring around the stem just under the cap.  They were easy to reconize if you knew what you were looking for.  </p><p>So we were young and looking for some answers, (and probably just looking to get messed up), and the shrooms were there all the time.  We would take them very frequently and had pleasant experiences with combinations of pot and alcohol.  It was the summer before 9th grade, we had no responsibilities.  So we tripped all the time.  Because we did it all the time, we got kind of nieve and one time got excessive.  </p><p>About ten of us were hanging out at my friend Jake's house.  Then a couple of us decided to go pick some shrooms.  So we did, there was a cowfield in the neighborhood.  We had a feild day, there were so many shrooms you couldn't even pick them all.  so we filled one of the big ziplock bags full (about the size of a textbook).  Then returned, to Jake's house.  We put them in a pan with enough water to cover them, and some koolade mix.  I don't know honestly how many were in there, but if I had to estimate, I would say probably 75 shrooms.  (a dose of about 6-9 would make me trip and get visuals).  Put the stove on high, boiled it for a while and chopped them up.  </p><p>After it cooled what we got was a purple mixture.  There were about four glasses I think.  I drank one and a couple of other people drank a glass.   Shortly after we were tripping balls.  I had never tripped that hard.  Everything got crazy.  We were swimming in Jake's pool and all messed up.  When I went underwater, the colors were awesome, it was really pleasant.  I noticed that all of us that drank it were really messed up.  One guy was freaking out saying that there were green spider webs all over his body, he was trying to get them off, It looked pretty funny to see him trying to swab them off.  Then another guy was inside fighting with the vacuum cleaner.  He was wrestling it on the carpet.  </p><p>I remember some of the visuals during this period.  When I looked in the trees, I saw goats that were just chillin staring down at me.  They had long beards.  Then I remember looking at stuff and it seemed like everything was made out of paper.  It seemed somewhat 2D when I looked at things at a distance.  I couldn't understand things that were far away.  Then I blacked out or something, I don't remember what happened for a while.  I remember being in the hottub.  We were in the middle of a thunderstorm.  It was thundering and lightning.  I was horrified but couldn't move.  I guess they had been trying to get me out for a while.  Then my dad shows up to pick me up.  I could not talk, could not do anything.  They carried me to the car.  I could not understand the interactions happening between people.  My dad drove me home and put me in my bed.  </p><p>I can't imagine how worried he was, stupid kid.  So my family is in my room staring at me with horrible lookes on their faces.  Can't ever forget the facial expressions, will feel bad for the rest of my life.  I kept trying to pull the blankets over my body because I was scared.  There seemed to be a glass dome over my body, I could reach through it but nobody else could.  The blankets would chill on top of it.  The next thing I know, there are about ten paramedics sourrounding me.  I thought they were police at first.  They strapped me to one of those boards, then pushed me down the driveway.  I was all messed up.  They put me in the ambulance and took me to the hospital.  One of the paramedics was trying to stick a needle in me.  I was freaking out, trying to stop him, but couldn't move because I was tied down.  To this day, I can't stand needles, they freak me out and make me sick to my stomach.  </p><p>The next thing I remember is waking up to my mom.  I was not tripping any more.  I don't know how they got me to come to.  They didn't even know what I was on.  They had to ask me what I was on, even drug tested me.  They kept me there overnight and I went home the next day.  I didn't do shrooms after that until recently.  The doctor said that I had a hearbeat so high that they thought I was going to die.  I can't imagine that I almost died with out even realizing it!  I felt horrible for putting my family members in so much stress and confusion.  They understood, they didn't ground me or anything.  They said that I had my consequence already, (they were right).  That was the scariest experience ever.  The only bad trip I have ever had, (have tripped probably around 150 times on acid, shrooms, and dxm).  </p><p>Lesson: There is a lot one can learn from altered states of consciousness, but keep in mind the dose.  Also, keep in mind family members before you do something that might hurt you.  It was the worst feeling to know that I stressed out people that love me so much.</p><p>Live, Learn, Have Fun, Grow, Experience, Care, Be Responsible, and Above all, Be safe.</p>"
