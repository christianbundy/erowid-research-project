I obtained a small amount of 2-CI from a questionable source (as most sources are).  However, I did my best to verify the off-white clumpy powder using analytical methods and I was satisfied with the identity of the substance.  I diluted about 50 mg of 2-CI in about 50 mL of 95% ethanol and at around 10 pm one nice Friday evening. decided to dose 8 mg. The following experience takes place in my home.<br><br>
T + 0:45-  I begin feeling the first subtle traces of a psychedelic experience.<br><br>
T+ 1:30- I am laying quietly on my couch.  I can feel the drug creeping up on me and I prepare myself for what is to come.<br><br>
T+ 1:45- The first visuals appear.  A shadow across the room is shifting and warping slightly.  I am beginning to experience waves of energy running the length of my body.<br><br>
T+2:30- The drug has really begun working now.  The popcorn ceiling above is horizontally melting/shifting. This hallucination reminds of a lot of LSD. For the next two hours I simply lay on my couch relaxing. The hallucinations are quite mild and do not force themselves on me.  This subtlety allows for some degree of control and I drift somewhere between dream and reality.  During this time I almost fall asleep, I am so relaxed.  <br><br>
During this period I experience some erotic feelings which are most pleasant.  Every once and a while I would have some rather powerful rushes of euphoria, almost MDMA like but with the intensity of a psychedelic experience.  I would compare these euphoric rushes to a previous experience I have had while under the influence of Mozart and LSD, however the 2-CI rushes were less powerful (probably only because of the low dose) and less pleasant.  Thats right- unpleasant euphoric rushes.  Overwhelming, high-energy surges of lightning.  Fortunately these were fleeting and I was able to sink back into my dream like state quickly. Some other negative side effects were also experienced during this time.  Sweating, cold-flashes, uncontrollable shaking, and intense thirst are a few.<br><br>
T+ 4:30- By this time the negative side-effects seem to have subsided and I am left in a pleasant and clean state of mind. I remember that I have taken only a small amount of this drug and am a bit curious to see what more would be like.  However I do not want to redose since it would take another hour and a half for the effects and it is getting late.  So instead of more 2-CI I figure I would smoke a little weed to intensify the hallucinations.<br><br>
I broke one of my most important rules while tripping: I smoked marijuana.  Weed ALWAYS clouds my mind and I am much more sensitive to succumbing to paranoia during a trip when I smoke it, but hey whats the harm in a little weed right?  So I pack a bowl of some medical grade shit and take one itsy bitsy hit.  Immediately my hallucinations escalate. So I take two more big hits.<br><br>
T+4:45- Oh shit this is cool. I turn on some music and enjoy the sounds and begin digging into suggested innuendos spoken in the song.  This is the start of the problem.<br><br>
T+5:00- I am finished with music for a while as I begin to think about the chemical structure of 2-CI. It is an interesting molecule with characteristics very different from other mind bending substances I have seen.  I begin to imagine a single 2-CI molecule charging through my brain.  Its gigantic Iodine molecule is forcing its way into places it shouldnt.  Barreling through my brain, smashing.  Iodines massive electron density is pulling every single nearby hydrogen molecule to it.  It is a beacon for any positive charge in my brain.  This visual greatly disturbs me.  I begin to wonder- why iodine? Why such a large atom? To what purpose?  Then I remember something about radioactive iodine and I start to worry about the possibility that I just ingested a radioactive substance and I would soon die of cancer.  This is not a pleasant thought. I remember that most people die from cancer but this does not comfort me in the least and I begin digging around for some potassium iodate that I have been saving in case of nuclear fallout <br><br>
T+6:00 I finally find the potassium iodate and take an adult size dose in hopes of curbing the consequences of radioactive iodine. ( In hindsight I realize it is much too late for the potassium iodate to be any help, but at the time it was the only thing I could think of to ease my mind.)  I never should have smoked that weed.<br><br>
T+7:00 the effects have mostly worn off and I am able to get some sleep.<br><br>
After-effects:<br><br>
The next day I was a bit more irritable than usual. Also, when I relax fully I can still see the popcorn ceiling moving.  Four days later I still detect the ceiling moving, granted each day the ceiling moves less and less and is nearly gone after the fourth day.<br><br>
While parts of the trip were enjoyable, the last half sucked.  The effects days after ingestion are a bit unsettling and the price of the drug is higher than LSD or mushrooms.  I'd rather take those drugs because the visuals are stronger without some of the nasty side-effects of phenylethylamines.  The visuals I experienced under the effects of this small dose of 2-ci are nearly comparable, but slightly less intense, than a hit of LSD.  The long term effects of this drug are entirely unknown and I would not reccommend this substance to anyone.<!-- End Body -->
