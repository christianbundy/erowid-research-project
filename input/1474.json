 "report": "<p>\nWell I had recently heard about how smoking nutmeg will make you trip, so I got the bright idea to try it.  I smoked about 2 tbspns of the stuff at about 7 at night.  After some how choking that stuff down I sat on my bed waiting for the fun to start.  After about 30 min. I started to develope a raging headache, so I figured maybe I hadn't smoked enough so I smoked another 2 tbsps.  </p><p>By this time my lungs felt like I'd smoked a pack and a half of unfiltered Lucky Strikes.  I found that not only had my headache not ceased and my lungs felt like shit, but I also felt like vomiting.  Finally about two hours later( and four aspirin later) my headache was gone.  In short it'll be a cold day in hell before I smoke that crap again.                                                  </p><p>(p.s. I decked my friend for his bright idea)</p>"
