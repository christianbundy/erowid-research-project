 "report": "<p>One day in the summer I received a call from my ex boyfriend and good friend Timmy, who was looking try ecstasy and wanted me to roll along with him since I had done it before. I grabbed my friend Shannon and we went to his house since his mom was supposed to be at work until late. While we were working out the situation with the E, our friend called and said he could get us some mushrooms, so we abandoned the E plan and bought 1/4 oz of shrooms. We divied it up so Timmy got an 1/8 and Shannon and I would split an 1/8 since we are both lightweights.</p><p>Around quarter of 6 in the evening I ate the mushrooms and chased them with a bit of OJ, then kicked back on Timmy's bed to watch some TV while we waited for it to kick in. The guy who sold us the shrooms stuck around along with another friend and his girlfriend. They had taken their shrooms about 15 minutes before we did. It was funny to see them trip out. The first things I noticed were inconsistencies in my perception. I looked at my legs and knew there was a blanket covering them, and yet I couldn't feel it. I felt a breeze on my legs instead. I wear glasses but as the shroom effect came on my vision sharpened and I found the glasses only gave me a headache, so I took them off for most of my trip. At one point I went upstairs and found myself staring at a poster some kids had made for Timmy's mom and giggling at the pictures on it. Then I turned around and noticed Timmy's carpet was purple. Suddenly I couldn't remember if it had always been purple, so I yelled down to Timmy and he told me it had been. Later in his room, I was suddenly aware that his walls were red, which I hadn't really noticed before.</p><p>I left Timmy's house along with Shannon around quarter of 7. I was enjoying my trip, but it was very manageable and mild so far. We sat on our friend Annie's porch swing for a while, waiting for my dad to come pick us up. I was getting into the back-and-forth motion of the swing, especially when my eyes were closed. Finally my dad came, and it seemed I could hardly walk to the car. I climbed in the back with Shannon and tried my hardest to conceal my trip.</p><p>About a mile down the road while I was gazing out the window I looked at the sun and it burned my eyes. I told Shannon this, and suddenly I was trying very hard not to giggle. I was afraid my dad would know I was tripping. I attempted to say things that would make my laughter seem appropriate, but the more I talked the stranger I knew I sounded, so finally I gave up and got quiet. We dropped off Shannon, and that's when I began to peak. Sitting in the back of the car I was still attempting to control myself. I found I could control my body movements, but then I would realize I was making goofy faces. Then when I attempted to keep my face normal, suddenly I would see my hand coming in to touch my face, then reaching out to touch the seat. Touching my face was definately cool. It was a merging of the senses. I could see it coming at me, and feel my face with my hand and feel my hand with my face, but I was processing all three senses seperately instead of jointly. I relaxed and seemed to feel my body shifting and growing and contorting in the backseat of the car.</p><p>I had to stop by my boyfriend's house, and I was very excited. I hadn't told him I was tripping but I was really looking forward to seeing him, much more than usual. We went to his room and chatted for a while. He kissed me and it was the most amazing thing. It felt so good I told him to kiss me again, so he did. After we chatted a while longer he casually asked me, 'So, what are you tripping on?' I was rather disappointed that he had been able to tell that I was acting goofy, but I was tripping so I didn't really care. I couldn't stay long though, because I had to go take care of some pets I was sitting for.</p><p>My dad wanted me to drive there, but I said I would rather ride in the passenger seat and read, which he accepted without question. Somewhere along the way I stopped caring about hiding my trip from my dad. I began chatting with him very enthusiastically about everything that came to mind. I noticed I was going into tangents and extreme detail on things that I knew weren't really important. I knew I was acting a little off, but I figured either my dad knew and didn't care, or he couldn't tell. By the end of the ride I had talked to my dad more than I had in the past month combined. I even agreed to go see a movie with him the next day.</p><p>We got to the house where I'm petsitting. I took care of the various things I had to do. My dad went to use the bathroom, and I spotted a package of cookies lying on the counter. For some reason I felt like I had to obtain those cookies. I didn't want to eat them, I just had to obtain them. But I didn't want anyone to see me. So while my dad was in the bathroom I grabbed a bunch and put them in my pants pocket. One of the things I had to do was let the hamster run around a track in its ball, so I sat down on the couch to give it exercise time. The house had vertical blinds that were moving ever so slightly in the air, and I stared at them for a long time, fascinated by the way they moved. Sometimes I wasn't sure if they were moving at all.</p><p>I finally got home and got online to talk to some friends. Talking to people was just so great, especially once I found friends who I could confide in that I was tripping on mushrooms. I noticed I kept talking about talking. I would say things like, 'I remember we were talking about (some subject) earlier, I want to talk about that again,' and then I would say everything I could think of about that subject. When I was done, I would abruptly change to a new subject, and yet it was all connected in my mind by some underlying theme. The whole time I kept feeling myself sort of change. I would feel as though I were five years old, and then suddenly I would think I was my best friend. I would start to remind myself of someone I knew until I felt like I *was* that person. I felt like I was five years old for a lot of the time.</p><p>As I was coming down from my trip, I talked to my boyfriend on the phone. It was probably the best conversation we ever had. I was suddenly unafraid to tell him everything I thought. I told him how much I really loved him and wanted to be with him forever. And I talked to him about why I get angry at him sometimes, and how I'm just covering because I worry that he doesn't feel the same about me as I do about him. I said a lot of things to him that I never would have said sober. (My mom came through on call waiting at one point and I told her I loved her, then I went back to my boy.) When I hung up the phone I said out loud to myself, 'Wow. I love that boy so much.' I had been talking to myself all day, except when I was in the car. I was rather enjoying my own conversation at times. </p><p>Shortly after I hung up with my boyfriend I felt my trip wind down and pitter away. I was left feeling tired and satisfied. I was so very content, and the day had made an impression on me about the way I deal with relationships. I realized that the honesty and openness I had felt on the shrooms were something I should strive for even when I wasn't tripping. All day I had felt that everything was exactly as it should have been, that everything was perfect the way it was, and that no matter what happened in the next moment it would all be groovy. That was also a feeling I wanted to keep with me beyond the trip. All in all, it was one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. It was fun, I made some great connections with my friends and my dad, and I gained insights that I kept with me after the trip was over.</p>"
