I have smoked salvia a handful of times, but it only affected me noticeably twice. The prior times produced no effects, probably because I did not smoke it properly (I believe that I may not have heated it enough. Also, I may not have inhaled it deeply enough.)<br><br>
However, when it did work, I experienced the most bizarre, vivid, and convincing visual hallucinations of my life. I have hallucinated visually while under the influence of marijuana, mushrooms, MDMA, MDA, and DXM, (and tactilely while under the influence of most drugs) but these hallucinations were less intense, because I could differentiate between reality and my experiences. <br><br>
I was sitting in my college dorm room in the evening with my boyfriend. He had brought me a bag of x20 salvia, which we decided to smoke out of a pipe while sitting on my bed. I was nervous beforehand, because I had spent time with tripping people and heard stories from friends about the severe nature of salvia trips. I had also smoked it once earlier, with moderate effects, but that was in conjunction with alcohol and marijuana. I had felt as though I were a 2-Dimensional character sinking into my surroundings, but I had felt comfortable and conscious of the fact that I was fucked up. <br><br>
In my bedroom, I smoked two hits to no avail. I smoked a third hit, inhaling very sharply and holding it in my throat for at least ten seconds. I looked out my window and noticed three girls walking on a path underneath me. I thought, This isnt working again. But as I turned to look at my door, my mouth dried up and the room segmented into parts in sync with my head turns. Three segments/head turns later, I was looking out the window again  the girls were gone, but I could still hear their voices. A birthday card with three Disney princesses sat to my left, and when I glanced at it, the girls voices suddenly belonged to the paper princesses. Looking back at the door, I imagined their voices just outside and waited for several seconds for them to walk into my room.<br><br>
I turned forward to look at my boyfriend. His head was patterned with many small, square, repeating diagrams of his face as if they were painted on a descending ladder. I focused on each diagram, seeing relatively tiny boxes of his face, approaching me with each descending step. This was very real and scary to me, so I closed my eyes, and laid down. I repeatedly mumbled that he needed to stop, and that everything needed to just stop. About thirty seconds later, I looked up and the ladder patterns were gone. However, I could only see portions of his head (one ear, half the face, his nose and half an eye, his chin) at a time. Once my vision returned to normal, I laid down again.<br><br>
I dont remember what I thought about with my eyes closed, or for how much time I laid down. Likely several minutes later, I looked up and the first thing I saw was a cupcake. I grabbed it, and hoarded it behind my head. My boyfriend was very hungry, so he tried to wrestle with me for it, but I was so desperate to eat it, that I shrieked, Let go of my little baby! Dont come near my damn baby! I was convinced that I had produced the cupcake and that he should not be allowed to share in the treat. I ate it really quickly.<br><br>
Unfortunately, I have little recollection of what I did or thought next. We probably smoked a bowl of weed, and then invited my friend over. She came, smoked a few hits of the salvia, freaked out that the room was a book closing on her, and shuddered in the corner. <br><br>
Once the effects had almost entirely faded about two hours later (?), the three of us stumbled around the school with our sober friends and devoured a pie of pizza. <br><br>
Although salvia was certainly not the most enjoyable or powerful recreational drug I have used, it produced the most vivid and convincing images I have ever seen. I would not like to use it very often, but as it may be illegalized soon, I plan to buy a fair amount for potential future use.<!-- End Body -->
