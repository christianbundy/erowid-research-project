 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI am a 21 year-old male.  I have smoked weed everyday for about six months and I have limited experience with Salvia Divinorum, 2C-I, mcat, and JWH-18. \r\nIt has been finals week here at University and as a result I have been pretty stressed. Still, tonight I was feeling good, it was early, and so spur of the moment I decided to pull out some of my 2c-I that Id been saving.  It was about 8PM, and given a come-up of roughly two hours, I knew it would be a perfect experience for a party I was going to later that night (around 11PM). My goal in consuming 2C-I this evening was to increase my connection with others at the party, and post-party to enjoy the visualizations and also pursue some introspection.\r\nI should note at this point that I am currently diagnosed with depression and have been taking Lexapro (escitalopram) 20MG daily for about 7 months.  I am very grateful for this drug  it has done wonders for my social and mental health.   Lexapro is an SSRI, rather than an MAO inhibitor, thus I consider it totally okay to consume with 2c-I, and most tryptamines in general.  I can confirm this both by personal experience and also from research done online. \r\nThe only side-effect escitilorpam seems to have on my experiences is that it mitigates the effects of hallucinogens.  This is definitely true with 2C-I and also Salvia  I just dont trip NEARLY as hard as my friends. Still, in no way do I recommend taking a larger dose of 2C-I to compensate; while the escitilopram reduces the mental effects, the physical effects such as heartrate increase and temperature irregulation are still present.\r\nSo, lets begin my night.  I am alone in my room.  Put on a lot of soft-light and begin typing up a list of all the blessings I have in my life.  Ive found this technique to be a great way to prepare my mind to become and remain positive for the experience. \r\n-4:00  Consume my daily 20mg of Lexapro  usually I do it in the morning, today I do it with dinner.\r\n0:00  Consume approx. 15mg of 2C-I orally on an empty stomach.  I say approximately because my scale is a little off.  Substance came in a base of hydrochloride salt  a fluffy white powder with no scent.  I simply put some on my finger, stuck on my tongue, and washed down with water.  Slight chemical taste.  \r\n+0:15  Smoke Cannabis sativa. I smoke weed every day throughout the day.  My tolerance is so high I dont really get very high anymore.  In my experience, weed is a great tool to maintain control of my trip if things begin to go south.\r\n+0:25  I feel a slight alert from the 2C-I.  Typical.  Full ride wont begin for another hour or so. Slight clenching of the jaw is apparent and will last all night.\r\n+1:30  Slight CEVs.  I am listening to Pachebel in the Garden - classical music mixed with nature sounds.  So soothing.  Music, and this album in particular, are incredibly enjoyable while on 2C-I.  \r\n+2:00  feeling a lot of empathy; thinking about my family and how much I love them.  Im mostly happy, but notice a slight bit of negative thoughts creeping in.  Im also bored.  The experience so far has been mostly bland.  \r\n+2:15  I go to a small house-party with some guys from my fraternity.  I found myself to be very talkative, and the number of people (40+) was in no way overwhelming.  No one knew I had consumed 2C-I except for two people I had told. I am having a lot of fun at the party  absolutely no alcohol for me, especially with this drug  though I step out two or three times during the evening to smoke weed with some friends.  I am much more sociable than usual  the music is also STELLAR.  I feel each thump of bass almost corresponds with my heartbeat.\r\n+5:00  I notice I have feelings of frustration and am not enjoying the party any longer.  Additionally, I can sense the 2C-I wanting to take over although its effects are negligible while at the party.  I walk home.\r\n+5:10  Walk into my room. BAM!  Im really feeling it all the sudden.  I feel a sense of disconnectedness from my surroundings  my room feels oddly foreign.  I lay in my closet in silence with the lights off.  I see visuals in my periphery.  Essentially, Im falling into what feels like a sea of demon babies. I see a constant torrent of crying babies whose eyes are darkened out and whose mouths are gaping open.  I do not find this frightening.  I say to myself, wow, so this is how my depression/anxiety is trying to manifest itself?  Bring it on, lets work through this.  I attempt to discover the roots of my anxiety, but this drug is not allowing for very much philosophical introspection.  Disappointing, but as I am learning, to be expected.\r\n+5:20  At this point I realize the substance is not affecting me nearly to the extent it should be.  I deem it safe and acceptable to mix about 6mg of 2C-I and a little bit of kief in my one-hitter.  I choose this method because I have never tried it, and the effects come on much more quickly.  I smoke it and it is an overbearing chemical taste.  I feel like a damn junkie with the way this smoke tastes. \r\n+5:23  BAM!  Hits me very quickly.  Wow.  The effects are so strong.  After waiting five hours, I finally am having the ride Im looking for.  I walk to my bathroom and look in the mirror.  My face is contorting itself into different shapes.  My eyes are small and my nose and mouth are growing.  I think to myself, I resemble a rat.  I am not disturbed by what I see. I can also control it.\r\n+5:35  Realizing this trip will offer nothing to me in terms of self-reflection, I decide just to enjoy it.  I lay in bed with Deadmau5 radio on Pandora playing.  I tried some dubstep but found it too dark than I could handle.  For a good 30 minutes I listen to music, enjoy CEVs  - mostly patterns that look like they have been rendered mathematically; lots of greens, constantly contorting.  I feel euphoric and perfect.  Im drifting in a world between sleep and wakefulness.  Although I am awake, it feels like a dream almost to the point that I feel I can control what will happen next.  \r\n+6:10  I decide to consume a shitload of chocolate my roommate gave me.  Its delicious.  I finish the chocolate by chugging about 32oz of water.  What a great night!  Kind of boring  - the 2C-I wasnt very strong this time - but for once I experienced absolutely no negative physical effects of the substance  it has been an easy-to-handle experience.\r\n+15:00  I wake up the next day and begin to go through my day.  Around noon I notice very strong feelings of nauseau.  Why?  I dont even think the 2C-I is in my system anymore.  I think nothing of it til I am hit very strongly with a need to vomit.  I vomit up a large amount of brown liquid  it smells like chocolate.\r\nFor the rest of the day I am vomiting up liquid and I have severe diarrhea.  I have never experienced this before as a result of 2C-I, and cant imagine 2C-I is the cause.  Is it? Or is it the chocolate?  Whatever it was, I spend the next 24 hours absolutely miserable and sick.  In hindsight, I think it was food poisoning from the chocolate.  The whole next day really put a damper on how I feel about my experience with 2C-I the day before.\r\nConclusion:\r\n2C-I is a great substance when used correctly.  I find it constantly increases empathetic feelings, provides good visuals, and allows for a ride that is easy to control.  Still, the next days illness makes me question whether the 2C-I is the culprit.  I will definitely do it again as soon as I am can convince myself that I will have a positive experience  both during and AFTER the trip.\n\n\n"
