 "report": "<p>Prior experience: Alcohol, Cannabis, Morning Glories, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Salvia Divinorum 5x and 10x, Blue Lotus 25x, opium, xanax, painkillers, ritalin</p><p>Setting: my apartment late in the evening during the winter</p><p>Set: During this time of the year I was very introspective and I was exploring theories regarding shamanism, myth, magick and reality.  I was also practicing new Energy Exercises for consciously inducing Out of Body Experiences (see Robert Bruce).  The energy exercises are basically manipulating my prana, chi, or kundalini energy.</p><p>I parachuted a 5 mg Vicodin pill.  Parachuting is basically crushing the pill inside a tissue and swallowing the tissue.  The vicodin kicked in within 20 minutes.  I was feeling waves of energy, probably from my energy building exercises from the previous week.  It felt good so I decided to potentiate the effect and smoked a bowl of medical grade marijuana in my bubbler.  I was told by the friend who gave this weed to me that it was Big Bud x Trainwreck.  Whatever it was, it was quite potent.  As a side note, marijuana sometimes makes me very paranoid and depressed.  Other times it makes me feel energized and my mind races with insightful and creative thought.</p><p>Immediately after smoking I felt extremely relaxed yet energized, this surprised me because I had expected the vicodin to knock me out.  I felt extremely social but no one in my building wanted to hang out this late so I read up on energy exercises and talked on aim.  This got boring, so I smoked another bowl full of red hairs.</p><p>At this point the energy in my body was uncontrollable, but I suffered from paranoid and delusional thoughts, sometimes positive and sometimes quite negative.  I couldnt control the energy waves anymore and they kept spiking to my third eye and crown chakras.  This was pleasurable at first, yet I felt as if energy was escaping me and I was not comfortable with not being able to control it.  I lay back to meditate and relax, but soon after the energy spiked and burst into my head.  My eyes were closed and I saw a large red eye, surrounded by darkness.  It was reminiscent of Saurons eye from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies.  There was a sense of evil and danger surrounding this vision.</p><p>This vision scared me and I felt as if proceeding any further would be quite dangerous to my system.  I tried to force the energy down into my legs and abdomen but I really had to push hard to keep it there and it kept trying to spike back into my skull.  I tried to tell myself I was hallucinating but it was too much.  I wanted to sleep but I felt that if I gave up conscious control over the energy waves they would spike back into my skull and I would learn more than I wanted to about this red eye.  I was afraid of what might happen as the vision was quite nefarious.  I simply was not ready.</p><p>I couldnt sleep and I believe I was having slight auditory hallucinations.  I also began to feel and visualize elf like creatures, reminiscent of visions I've had on salvia, walking into my body through my anus and nose.  It was very very unsettling. It could not have been the pot alone, and I doubt the vicodin could potentiate the mental effects to this degree.  Something deeper was going on and I suspect it was the activation of certain subtle energy centers.  Though the weed seemed to activate my energy, it also gave me way too much paranoia to actively explore this headspace.</p><p>I have never found marijuana at all helpful in meditative practice or in the exploration of altered states.  It tends to confuse me and push me into negative headspace.  This experience strengthened my dislike of cannabis which I have recently completely quit using.  The next morning after my third eye area felt quite activated.  I wish there was more documented on the effect of various drugs on subtle energy systems.</p>"
