 "report": "<p>On snorting the full 160mg of K last night I got the biggest head rush of my life. With every pound of my heart I could feel blood rushing through the vessels and reaching every part of my body. My chest began to buzz, my blood seemed warm and seemed to transfer the buzz to my fingers, toes and nose.</p><p>The first thing that happened was everything became pixelated, my friends faces became much more like those old computer games where the characters are made of squares. Our voices seemed to be coming out of each other we breathed in unit and spoke over each other and didn't say the same things but completely responded to each other. I felt like I was melting into the floor and this moment and my heart began to feel like it was compressing. Swallowing became such a chore, my breathing caused my heart to beat faster and I could feel every alveoli in my lungs filling with air. I thought I was going to die but my hallucinations were too strong to react to this thought. My body melted onto the floor and I tried lifting up my right hand but found that my skin had melted onto the floor and looked like stringy cheese attached to the floor.</p><p>My mind felt like it was left on the blanket and everything went black, the walls of the room were no longer there, it was just me, and my 2 friends lying on a blanket in the middle of darkness. I felt then that I was falling onto my body from above slowly floating down in a circular pattern. When I landed on my body I began to shiver and my jaw wouldnt stop shaking, I seemed to shiver to the beat of the traditional Japanese music we were listening to. We had a weird dialogue were my friend said I am Mark and me and my other friend repeated the exact same thing in the exact same tone and voice but carried the --rk in Mark on for what seemed like hours. I began to feel like I was falling and was getting quite distressed, one of my friends took my hand, which seemed to stop the sensation. </p><p>I whole body started to shiver and I began to feel cold. Colours were flashing around me. By this time me and my friends where comprised of just our heads, there were no noticeable body shapes. The eyes were the most striking feature of the face, they looked completely 2D i.e. both on the same side of the face. They were outlined in thick black lines and every blink seemed to change the actual colour of their eyes. The coldness began to take over and I felt like I was getting wet, I straightened my head to look up, even though my head felt like it weighed a ton and a massive wave of water washed us away. I could feel the movement caused by the wave I felt like I was moving away from where we were before it hit us. Next thing I remember we were lying on grainy gold sand and as I turned my head towards my friends they started to take on a more 2D shape and began to look like those hieroglyphs you often see in books.</p><p>My friend got up and went to sit on the couch, I was not aware of the couch existing until my friend sat on it and made it light up. I began to ask where I was, my voice pounded in my head, and my mouth would move and speak the words but the time between the 2 seemed so distant. My body didn't feel like it was mine, I had to fight with it to do everything, swallowing would cause me to grab my throat and massage it to make the spit go down. I felt like I was trying to swallow my tongue. I now began to feel warm and comfortable, I kept saying come with me on a journey through time and space which is a line from one of my fave tv programs. I began to see stars and felt like I was floating in space. I invited my friends to come with me to the sun.</p><p>I floated, not aware of whether my friends were there or not, towards a bright white light. As I got closer it took on more of a circular shape and the warmth was growing. I began to feel uncomfortable with the heat and began to float away saying to my friends now come with me to Jupiter. I remember passing the Earth on my trip and suddenly felt like as I moved away from the earth towards Jupiter I left tiny particles behind so by the time I reached Jupiter all that was left was my thoughts, I didnt look like me I was just a collection of thoughts. </p><p>I don't really remember much after that the next thing I know Im reciting equations in a really monotone voice and the room begins to take more shape. I become aware of the music and can see notes flying from my computer to the ceiling and making the ceiling bounce like the skin of a drum. I am now aware of the lamp shade and can carry out a simple conversation in a monotone voice. My speech seemed slurred but what I was saying seemed to make sense. </p><p>The ceiling kept changing shapes. My head still seemed like it was separated from my body and I tried standing up to go to toilet. Walking felt so incredibly strange I couldn't understand how I was causing my legs to move. On the come down I felt like I didn't have control over my body and felt really tired. I lay down on my side and woke up this morning feeling completely normal until I had my first spliff. </p><p>I would definitely do this again. I remember feeling so scared at times because I wasnt sure what was going to happen and how long for. The whole trip lasted about 3 hours and was completely surreal. Having done it once I think I would not be so scared the next time as Id know more what to expect. The visual hallucinations seemed to occur in separate stages i.e blocky, then 2D, then out of body etc. After each hallucinatory experience I expected to come down and when I didn't I began to panic a bit but that soon disappeared and I was left calm to enjoy the experience.</p>"
