INTRODUCTION<br><br>
Description of subject, the writer.<br><br>
Subject: Male, age 30'ish, weight 80kg, height 1.78cm<br>
Health:  Good physical health, hayfever, asthma.<br>
Mental:  Diagnosed ADHD-PI<br>
Medication taken two days earlier: 100mg valium, 8mg xanax.<br>
Medication taken same day: 10mg Lexapro, bronchodilator, antihistamine.<br><br>
Harm-reduction disclaimer<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I felt obliged to note the excessive intake of valium and xanax I took two days earlier since half-life of benzos can be quite long and I don't know if it affects MDPV.<br><br>
Now for the MDPV, this is really important to take note of. I have read lots of reports of inability to stop redosing MDPV, fiendish! Be warned that this seems to be the standard with MDPV and a harsh come-down.<br><br>
However I did not at any time feel any urge to redose at any time after initial dose. Neither did I experience any comedown or crash, instead just such a slow comedown to baseline I didn't notice it. Whether it was depending on the combination of Lexapro, my mood and mindset or setting, further trials will tell if any.<br><br>
==============================================================================<br><br>
Description of situation before intake of substance:<br><br>
Mindset: Just home from weekend at countryside house. Peaceful and curious.<br>
Setting: Home alone. I have had a full nights sleep and fully rested, and in a neutral mood and had a medium meal at 15 o clock.<br><br>
-------------------------------------------<br><br>
The text is written in real-time, and I tried to edit as little as possible to show the change of mind and whatever. However I had to edit away rather large stories as my mind wandered to other things in this same document as sleepyness and focus on the report was lost.<br><br>
Description of the substance<br>
----------------------------<br>
Container is ca 3x2 inch ziplock brand RIPPIE, with a white label. Label has black text MPDV 500mg left side, and to right black square marking with three smaller squares upper left, lower left, upper right.<br><br>
The contents are a white salt, a bit chunky. Smells faintly citrus. Taste is chemical but not nasty. It solves in water with some effort. Snorting it is painless.<br><br>
Description and timeline of the MDPV<br>
------------------------------------<br><br>
18.00  	30mg of MDPV is taken nasal and 30mg MDPV orally solved in water.<br>
	Unknown amount of snuff tobacco is consumed.<br><br>
18:05 	Non-placebo obscure active substance in bloodstream.<br><br>
18:15 	A weak stimulating body and head buzz.<br><br>
18:30 	Negatives:<br>
	Minor jaw-tension. <br>
	Involuntary movement of tounge and lips when not focusing.<br>
	This would be a chewing gum moment in social setting.<br>
	Increased pulse.<br>
	Hands tremble a bit, though barely noticable.<br>
	Tiny tactile and balance loss, which I suppose would go unnoticed.<br><br>
18:40	Bodyload a chilled out stoned stimulation.<br>
	Thoughts and memory becoming light, mindfulness and peace.<br><br>
18:50	Eyes are still like baseline, there is zero dilation of pupils.<br>
	Above mentioned side-effects remain.<br>
	Positive effects have remained a plateau since 18:30.<br><br>
19:00   Breathing has grown a bit more shallow but no issue.<br>
	THe head sensations has spread, and is felt all over head, <br>
	primarily at frontal cortex and temples.<br><br>
19:20	What is not:<br>
	Speed, activation, euphoria, cns-stimulation, sexual arrousal, <br>
	social enhancement, ego-boost, and hyperactivity.<br><br>
	What is:	<br>
	Relaxation, a calm mix of stony body/mind stimulation, mindfulness.<br>
	The content of being is a sanctuary from impressions.<br>
	Everything just is but no name for any of that.<br>
	Release of naming, release of words and knowledge of anything.<br>
	The mind feels a bit like how I imagine being 2-3 years old.<br><br><br>
19:30	Taking a pause for now in noting.<br>
	I lie down in sofa and enjoy listening to the wind from the window. put on Beethoven's seventh, which I normally can't listen because the beauty overwhelms me.<br>
	How will it affect me now?<br><br>
20:00	The music is passing through me without many emotions.<br>
	Music appreciation is not heightened, but rather disturbing my bliss.<br>
	but it activates me for what to do next.<br><br>
21:00	I am now having a discussion on the net with a friend.<br>
	She tell me I am writing a lot and inspired. <br>
	I have no problem of changing subject and being apprehensive of her,<br>
	but only after she mentioned my intense writing.<br>
	This means I am entering a speedy phase of mind certainly although<br>
	I didn't notice. Now the bodyload has lessened also.<br><br>
21:30	Activation and speedy mind now. Communicating is important. <br>
	Keeping focus on writing this report is decreased.<br>
	Interesting note, I am feeling a betterment in my ADHD.<br>
	I can focus better, switch focus between things without stress,<br>
	and I do not feel the constant wornout mental feeling.<br><br>
22:20	I am listening to Shakti. The speediness has lessened to a more<br>
	normal state. I feel normal actually. <br>
	Mentally I feel somewhat like when I were on Ritalin without<br>
	the nasty nausea I would get from it.<br>
	I am not feeling any urge to redose which is odd, considering this<br>
	has been reported. <br>
	I have yet to experience any comedown and what it is like.<br>
	I am very hesitant to say this is good for ADHD even though I<br>
	presently get this feeling - I know it is only a temporary high.<br>
	The problem is firstly the effect now is different from 2 hours ago.<br>
	Now the bodyload has disappeared and feeling rather sleepy peripherally. Head is still stimulated but in a less speedy way. In a almost natural awakened way, if I may say so since I don't know 	how it is for normal people. I feel awake now, but thoughts are not racing.<br><br>
23:00	I have got some rather good things done during the evening.<br>
	I wrote a poster with reminders for making budget which is a constant<br>
	problem for me, and also a mental reminder how to handle medications<br>
	and drugs in a way which works for me to not get addicted or abusing. <br>
	Posted it on the wall for everyday reading in the morning.<br><br><br>
01:50   A very creative state of mind during the last three hours.<br>
	Loosing attention for this writing and enjoying texting online with<br>
	friends. I got a very clear mind for expressing some important issues<br>
	with a person who I found share some different experiences of reality <br>
	which is very lonely to have nobody share with. I appreciated it very <br>
	much. Focus is lost for writing more on the report in realtime, I am<br>
	enjoying texting with friends and my stoned attention is still<br>
	spinning with many ideas. Bodyload is gone and just tiredness.<br><br>
05:00	Oh well, very sleepy.. The last six hours just passed like a breeze, <br>
	can't believe it. Still having a alert head, but sleepy body. <br>
	This is sure a long acting substance.<br><br>
06:00	Back to baseline I think. What is now is the beyond sleepyness where I 	can get a false wakeful alertness, and refuse to go to bed although I know I would fall asleep in minutes and really need it and instead doing obsessive compulsive things. I am wary of going into a trance-like state which happen to me when underslept underfed and when the dopamine floods. <br><br>
08:00	I wrote a story of an life changing experience I had one year ago,<br>
	that I always wanted to get down on paper to a texting friend on the net. <br>
	I am reminded by a person on the net to sleep now, and take the advice <br>
	before I enter zombie-state. I have forgotten to eat properly.<br>
	Water as needed. Sleepy time now.<br><br>
10:00	No sleepy time yet, getting up now and then turning rolling in bed.<br><br>
13:00	I take a shower and do some business downtown. ADHD-confusion made worse by tiredness, noisy - crowded - ugly movement - aura of stress.<br><br>
14:00	I take my adhd-medication Modiodal [modafinil] 100mg.<br><br>
15:00	Now I am trying to sleep again, being pissed off so taking 2mg xanax, 20mg valium and 15mg zolpidem. but alas no sleep. I realized I should not have taken the Modiodal which actualy now is waking me up. 	<br><br>
20:00	I spend the rest of the evening playing online game and beeing buzzed<br>
	on valium coffee and xanax, and wondering if a lower dosage of MDPV<br>
	yields lower duration than 18 hours.<br><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
SUMMARY OF MY PERSONAL TRIAL<br><br>
Positives: 	very slow comedown<br>
		no redosing-urge<br>
		no euphoria<br>
		mellow stimulation <br>
		none to minor pupil dilation depending on dosage.<br>
Negatives: 	jaw-tension<br>
		wiggling lizards tounge<br>
		anorectic<br>
		double vision on high dosage/going long time<br>
Neutral:   	Kept me awake for extremely long time.<br>
		Had many different long plateaus of varying effects<br>
duration:  	18 hours total including ultra slow comedown.<br>
Combination: 	10mg Lexapro (SSRI)<br>
Tolerance-build: To find out<br><br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
POSSIBLE USES I THOUGHT OF AFTER FIRST TRIAL<br><br>
Medicational uses:<br>
* If taken in early morning in low dosage could potentialy be trialed for surrogate adhd-medication for emergency or very occasional energizer.<br>
* I strongly would disagree trying to take this DAILY as surrogate adhd-medication or energizer because finding a correct dosing that doesn't build tolerance I suspect would be very troublesome and also given the generally accepted FIENDISHNESS which I however did not experience. Not to mention reaching a steady state with eye-balling or even a scale with 1-2mg diff would be impossible.<br><br>
Best usages in my opinion:<br><br>
* I strongly would like try a whole day at a carnival, hanging out with friends talking philosophical or rubbish topics would be proper, festival, or just relaxing a sunny day in the park would be nice. <br>
* A creative tool for a fine day of painting or writing or whatever artform. The plateaus of different effects make it both a peculiar and entertaining unreliable source for varying unexpectedness in creative outbursts! AND DO NOT BRING A BAG TO AVOID REDOSING.<!-- End Body -->
