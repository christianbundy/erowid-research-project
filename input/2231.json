 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFriday March 20 (the first day of spring!) I decided to explore 5-MeO-DMT again. I prepared a substrate of ash and crushed oregano and loaded a small amount of 5-MeO on top of this. Not sure of the amount used since I have no scale but it was roughly half again what I used on my last experiment. <br>I smoked it sitting up, in one big toke. I first tried to melt and vaporize as much of the crystal as possible, then allowed the flame to burn the oregano and inhaled all the smoke produced. I set the pipe down as soon as I finished smoking it. <br>Within seconds of setting the pipe down I was aware of a humming, buzzing energy filling me up. By the speed it was coming on and the intensity of the early sensation I knew I had succeeded in going further than I had on previous attempts. I just had time to lie back before being launched into hyperspace. <br>By the time my head hit the pillow I was firmly in the grip of the 5-MeO. Behind my closed eyelids (I think they were closed) there was a tremendous amount of movement. Actually, I'm not sure I would even call it a visual. It was as much a feeling as a seeing, and more properly a being. I felt like I was immersed in and merged with a rapidly folding, stacking geometric pattern in multiple dimensions. <br>The sensation was very intense, even overwhelming. Not overwhelming in the sense of 'Oh god, this is too much!' but overwhelming in the sense that it was all that was registering on my brain. I wasn't having any thoughts or feelings, I wasn't aware of the room or my body. Everything was focused on and contained by the universal puzzlebox that I was experiencing. It was very much a feeling of 'cosmic unity', a sense of being very in touch with the true universe. <br>The first perception I had of my body was an awareness that a tear was trickling down my face. A few seconds after that I became aware of my breathing and I followed it back to my body and the familiar space of my bedroom. As I 'came back' to my body, I felt a little nausea. I opened my eyes and found everything still moving and psychedelicized. Again I felt profoundly at peace, as after my last experiment with 5-MeO, and again the energy transformed into a powerful sexual awareness as things settled down more firmly into my physical body. <br>I lay there for a few minutes in reflection, thinking about the experience. I began making a sort of 'happy noise' and waving my arms in the air to make trails. This time I felt I had definitely got what I was after and avoided the 'dreaded underdose'. It left me amazed, profoundly at peace, and horny. About this time the phone rang and I answered it and talked to my brother. I was still a little spacey, and seemed to have some small difficulty following the conversation. After getting off the phone, the effects had more or less dissipated completely. <br>The whole experience was very short, maybe eight to twelve minutes total. It was also VERY intense, with some uncomfortable body effects ('weird' breathing, a little shakiness, and a small amount of nausea). However, this was more than offset by the sense of peace it left me with and the fantastic sensation of being merged with the core of the universe. <br>This experience has left me firmly convinced that 5-MeO is one of my allies. I find it illuminating and rewarding. I would like to reiterate that this is a very powerful trip, and probably not for everyone. If you choose to experiment with this, please use EXTREME caution. \n\n\n"
