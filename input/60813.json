 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI experimented with Sage Goddess Emerald Essence on three occassions in 2003.  This is a report of my experiences on those three occassions.  To give you some background, I have practised various meditation techniques since 1990, and have had the occassional interesting and 'meaningful' dream experiences and 'visions' which I attribute to particularly successful meditation sessions.  I am attracted to the philosophies of Advaita, Buddhism and Zen, which describe the phenomenal universe and the sense of self as illusory, with Awareness being the sole underlying reality.  I really do not have much of a record of experimenting with drugs, hallucinogens or entheogens, except for using pot sporadically, and a sole LSD experience on top of a hill in the forests that was entertaining, but not particularly coherent or meaningful.  In other words, all my so-called 'meaningful' experiences have been either spontaneous or meditation-induced, not substance-induced.\r\nSalvia Experience #1 (sometime in 2003):\r\nI was on the floor of my bedroom at night.  I squirted a couple of dropperfuls of Emerald Essence into my mouth and held the stinging, bitter liquid in my mouth for about 20 minutes.  I spat the liquid out, and feeling very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep.  Something was conscious of a very loud, deep bass thumping sound, and an enveloping darkness.  I say 'something', because I was not aware of myself as a human or an embodied, self-aware being, in some sense, I was the sound.  But yet paradoxically, 'I' was aware of the sound.  The sound was extremely loud and I could not figure out what it was, nor was I making any attempt to discern its cause.  Why would I?  I was just aware, with no motive.  I could hear every nuance in this sound.\r\nSlowly, awareness of self returned.  The source of the sound suddenly dawned upon me, it was my heart beating.  I was now aware of myself as a tiny point somewhere deep inside my body, in total darkness (my eyes were closed), and I could hear my heart beating deeply, loudly, as if it were filling a cathedral.  This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as I opened my eyes and the effect wore off, my sensory perceptions returned to 'normal'.  In retrospect, the experience did not feel like a hallucination at all.  Instead, it felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience.\r\nSalvia Experience #2 (sometime in 2003):\r\nI was in the same setting as in the previous experience, on the floor of my bedroom.  After holding the Emerald Essence in my mouth for about 20 minutes, I spat the liquid out, and again, feeling very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep.  This time, 'I' was conscious of a very loud, rushing sound, and an enveloping darkness.  Again, the sound was extremely loud and all encompassing, and as before, you could say that I was the sound.  I could hear every nuance in this sound.  When my awareness of self returned, the source of the sound suddenly dawned upon me, it was my breathing.\r\nI was now aware of myself as a tiny point somewhere deep inside my body, in total darkness.  My body was still asleep and breathing restfully.  I could hear every nuance in the sound of my breathing with a heightened perception.  Think of being in a giant wind tunnel and hearing the wind rush by.  This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as I opened my eyes and the effect wore off, my sensory perceptions returned to 'normal'. Again, the experience felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience.\r\nSalvia Experience #3 (sometime in 2003):\r\nOn this occassion, I was alone at home in the daytime.  If I recall right, I took a larger dose than on the previous two occassions.  After holding the Emerald Essence in my mouth for about 20-30 minutes, I lay down with my eyes closed.  Soon, I started seeing visuals, strange geometric patterns and colors that I perceived to be 'trivial' and mildly annoying.  At some point, my sense of self dissolved completely.  I suddenly felt I had become a set of buildings, roads and vehicles in the neighborhood I grew up in as a teenager.\r\nI was not a human or organic being anymore, I was a set of insentient objects.  There was simply no memory of my past existence as a person.  What's more, I wasn't one, I was many.  This was the weirdest sensation of them all.  We are normally used to being or identifying with one thing or self, not a multiplicity of things at the same time.  While the imagery associated with this feeling was a typical hallucination, the experience of being many things at once is apparently within the capacity of the mind, otherwise I could not have experienced it.\n\n\n"
