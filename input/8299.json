 "report": "<p>\nGenerally when people hear the word 'drugs' their first thought is of *serious* substances like Cocaine or LSD. Tobacco, and even Cannabis are rarely associated with that initial idea of drugs. And fewer still are those who think of prescription medications when considering drug use. </p><p>I was diagnosed with having calculii ('stones') in my kidneys a week ago, after collapsing in pain at work. My doctor prescribed Vicodin (hydrocodone) to eliminate the current and expected discomfort while my body was expelling the stones. I had only experimented with Cannabis, alcohol, methamphetamine ('crank') and MDMA ('Ecstasy') prior to this new prescription. All of my drug trips, save alcohol, had been negative due to my incredible susceptibility to paranoia and panic attacks. NOTHING made me feel good.</p><p>Naturally, I was hesitant to take Vicodin knowing that it was related to Heroin...a drug which I considered extremely dangerous. But the pain won and I reached for the pills with a mix of apprehension and desperation. (Not exactly the most ideal mentality to possess going into any drug use.)</p><p>I poured a glass of milk, singled out a pill, and in one command decision, popped it in my mouth and swallowed.  And waited.  </p><p>Didn't take long on an otherwise empty stomach for the effects to set in.</p><p>Approximately ten minutes after taking the pill I began to notice a slight easing of the pain.  I lay down on my bed and concentrated on the new feeling of lessened agony (what a novel idea!) About ten minutes after that I was QUITE aware of a complete cessation of all pain. But that was only the beginning. I felt great. I sat up and walked outside to have a cigarette. I was intent on making sure that I remembered every single sensation and effect that the Vicodin was having (and would have) on me so that I could understand the drug, and myself, better. (Something that is very important when it comes to ANY kind of experience, drug or otherwise.) </p><p>I noticed that my breathing became slow and soft...much like the pattern of breathing in an individual who is asleep. I felt distinctly relaxed and cheerful. At work the next day, now convinced that Vicodin was a pretty wonderful drug, I found myself accomplishing tasks that I normally would have ignored or put off. I felt completely at ease and noticed that all day long my breathing was slow but relatively shallow. My movements were graceful and precise, but I definitely noticed that it took LONGER to accomplish said tasks, despite my willingness to perform them.  For example, I would catch myself 'zoning out' or repeating certain actions like sweeping the same spot lazily. </p><p>My boyfriend on the phone that night noted a marked sedation to my behavior and language...I drawled words and spoke softly and lost track of thoughts or gave up entirely on others. Because Vicodin is a 'painkiller' (although it works by not actually getting rid of pain, but changing the brain and body's perception of it,) it consequently caused me to feel NO pain of ANY kind...including the pangs of hunger.  I hadn't eaten for a whole day. And it also caused me to be completely *lazy* in the sense that, once I had finally sat down, I could hardly muster the energy (or desire) to move. I lay in bed and literally stared at the wall for two hours without moving so much as a finger. But I felt fantastic. </p><p>I am a relatively heavy smoker and cough several times a day...my lungs' normal reaction to smoke filling them.  But while taking the Vicodin, I didn't cough ONCE. My boyfriend found this humorous and was actually the one to point it out to me that I hadn't coughed in days. While this effect is nice, it's not necessarily beneficial, as coughing is the body's way of getting gunk out of the lungs. And cigarette smoke is some serious gunk.</p><p>Other effects I've noticed (still taking the drug) are; sudden onset and 'wave-like' drowsiness, constant but not excessive happiness, positive mindset in general, slight constipation, less frequent urination (what was my doctor thinking?!), trouble focusing and retaining simple thoughts, slow to VERY slow breathing and a change in breathing patterns, and an alternately lowered and elevated ('tide-like') sexual drive including a respective ability to reach orgasm...it took me THIRTY MINUTES to climax one night, and two minutes another. (The last being one of the most interesting effects a drug has ever had on me.) </p><p>All in all, Vicodin has had no negative effects, some neutral effects, and many positive ones. HOWEVER...I should note that I started by taking one pill every four hours and am now taking one pill every two hours...and even those effects are wearing off. There is a definite build-up of tolerance happening. So far, this is the only drug that has not left me frightened, paranoid, sick, or unhappy. Now I'm just concerned that I don't get too attached to it.</p>"
