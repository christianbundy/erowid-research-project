Dose: 45 mg oral gelcap 4:15pm  (ate spaghetti at 1:15pm)<br><br>
4:30 feel stuff happening in stomach, tingle in extremities.  No nausea though --note: use of mda 60 hours ago, &amp; cannabis @ 4:20--<br><br>
4:37 music has extra beauty<br><br>
4:40 tingle is in head and posture is reminiscent of mdma/mda<br><br>
4:50 hr is up, am I tripping? Some visual activity<br><br>
5:05 getting harder to write the paper I have been writing since the beginning of this session. Thoughts stray a bit<br><br>
5:24 went to get mail. No eye dilation as of yet.  Lights starburst, trails, things look shinier than usual, energy up.  Still very much in a come up stage (it would seem). Comfortable +1.5<br><br>
5:30 body temp up. Very in the zone, amped.<br><br>
5:43 go to class<br><br>
6:00 +2 hr still up. Focused. I might be tripping<br><br>
7:00 feeling generally good and some tinglyness<br><br>
8:30 class is getting to me<br><br>
9:00 smoke +3. Im very talkative and wired, cannabis added alot to this experience.<br><br>
10:00 smoke.  Low level visuals, tracers and stuff. Energy persists.  Very good with cannabis.<br><br>
1:00am the substance is wearing off, Im still at a +2. Im not really noticing oevs but there are some cevs that should put me to sleep.  Sleep shouldnt be difficult.<br><br>
Commentary:<br><br>
I woke up the next day feeling alert (Im usually not) and I was still at a +1 until I had eaten lunch<br><br>
I would describe this chemical as if you were to cross mda w foxy.  Good energy rush, good social vibe.  HR definately went up, body temp too.  Mixed great w cannabis.  Would be great for party situations.  The trip does not get overwhelming and I felt no nausea.  Watch out for the amphetamine in here, lots of energy.<br><br>
My dose was good for oral but I have found that low doses smoked are very effective (like 5 mg).  I would expect the nasal route to be quite effective but would not recommend starting with too high a dose because of the potency observed when smoked.<br><br>
This is not mdma, it's kind of like mda but definately a unique substance.<!-- End Body -->
