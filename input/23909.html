I was warned when I warned young, my parents told me to stay away, they made it sound like it was deadly, and being fucked up just was not the way. Have you ever heard curiosity killed the cat, I guess thats how the story starts. This isnt bullshit, its coming strait from the heart. Its almost too good to be true, the way it makes you feel, and fuck the money that I spent, I swear I got the better deal.<br><br>
When I really felt it, when the  acting geeked shit was over, my whole life seemed to be moving just a little slower. I always said it wouldnt happen to me, this shit will never take me in. And now its apart of my life, like its one of my best friends. I feel like a cartoon because of the way my bodys moving, and mom you said this shit is bad, to me its super soothing. <br><br>
God made this plant for us. Not for it to kill you, start getting high, and it might bring out the real you. I sit down in my chair, put my feet up to recline, fire up the bowl, and now Im on cloud nine. Now my head is spinning, Im really working on a buzz, I havent a care in the world, and I owe it to the drugs. Fuck drinking beer, it only makes me feel dumb. So I swallow a few zanex, two will get me numb. Im thirsty as hell but I cant get up to walk, and I would ask my mom, but I dont have the spit to talk. Now Im not a druggie, and this isnt all I do.<br><br>
I used to like sports, and I go to a blue ribbon school. I havent lost my friends, and I still have an interest in life, these drugs are only helping, I promise Im doing it rite. I showed up at my buddies, there were people all around. So I headed for his room, only to burn a couple down. Around an hour later, when all the weed was smoke, my friend said he had a surprise, then he pulled out a bag of coke. I didnt want to look at it because I just wasnt down to get involved, he insisted that its harmless, and all my problems would be solved.<br><br>
He dumped it on a piece of glass, a pile as bright as snow. Then reality set in, and it was hard as fuck to just say no. He seemed to be a pro, the way he was using the razor blade to perfection. It was no longer just a pile, they split into four equal sections. I watched him roll up a dollar bill, I was glued to his every move, he had a dirty smile on his face, as if he had something to prove. He put the dollar in his nose, and quickly sniffed a line, got up and cleared his throat, and everything was fine. He passed it to his right, and now Im third in line.<br><br>
I tried to anticipate the feeling, but that I couldnt find. Because never in my life, had I thought of snorting lines. I was waiting for my conscious, to kick me in the ass. The next thing I knew, they were passing me the glass. My brain shut down, and I excepted it with open arms. It happened in the matter of seconds, and all I thought was darn. Five minutes later, the high had just kicked in, I was on top of the world. I was everyones best friend. The guilt left my mind, like a bad told joke. And what I failed to realize was, I just did coke.<br><br>
Its honestly hard to admit that what I did was wrong, at least I wasnt hooked, or should I say not for long. Get out your books children, get ready for todays lesson, and I hope your taking notes, todays topic is aggression. They say it makes you horny, and when your with a girl it hits the spot, it was forty dollars for one pill, so I knew I wouldnt roll a lot. I was full of rage, as blood covered my fists, it was the last night of the summer, I added xtacy to the list.<br><br>
I spent all my money for this upper, and it only made me pissed. December 7th, it was Christmas Dance night, I knew I needed something special, to get me feeling rite. I showed up at the dance higher then a kite, not knowing that night, would be the best of my life. We showed up at some guys apartment, that consisted of just one big room, and on the table I saw a bag, filled to the top with shrooms. I dropped thirty dollars on an eighth, just to see what the shit would do. I had heard they get you fucked, but the experience to me was new. Cap after cap, and damn they were hard to chew. After finishing off the bag, I desperately had to spit, are you sure these are shrooms, I could have swore I was eating shit.<br><br>
Now you might think Im clowning, from what Im about to say, but with the blink of an eye, his walls turned from white to gray. My eyes kept playing tricks, and every ten minutes I would hear a voice, but all I realized was, I had found my drug of choice. Call me a druggie or call me worthless, I could give a fuck what people say. At least Im here to talk about it, and remember, tomorrows just another day.<!-- End Body -->
