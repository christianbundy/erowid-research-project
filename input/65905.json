 "report": "<p>So, I just moved far away from home.  Haven't found the reliable herb connect yet.  But alas, I have all my mood/sleep aid supplement bottles.  I worked in a supplement store for a while where I learned about many different supplements, not just ones that give a legal high.</p><p>Anyway, one night, I was really wishing I had a bowlpack.  I wasn't stressing or anything, I was just in a great mood, feeling really relaxed in this heady new apartment my girl and I just moved into and felt like puffing a fatty bowl of the goodness.  But there was none.  So I decided to go on over to the old-school, non-working ice-box built into the wall where I keep all my supplements.  It's the perfect little nook to keep them all fresh. Cool and dark.</p><p>I had combined high doses of passionflower and valerian many times before to help me sleep and combined lower doses of passionflower, valerian, and kava just to chill out.  And it was all good every time except when I was drinking beer before bed and and took passionflower without even thinking about it and woke up with a serious headache and couldn't figure out why until it just clicked one night.  Never had one of those headaches again.  I also want to note that passionflower with cubensis is an awesome trip, maybe one of my favorite trips ever, but that's a whole other story.  This night, however, I wanted to really feel it.  So I took two capsules from each of the valerian (350mg extract), passionflower (100mg), and holy basil bottles, and put two droppers-full of kava tincture into a small glass of water and took it all down.  Dropping the kava tincture into the water had a really cool effect.</p><p>So now I'm waiting to feel totally chilled out.  Probably within ten, fifteen minutes, I start to feel nice.  My girl put in a movie and we watched that.  I felt super-chill the whole time. Then we went to sleep after the movie.</p><p>That night, for the first night in a long time, I had the craziest dream.  It was one long story, each part of the dream led logically (well dream-logically anyway) into the next part of the dream.  The thing was, the whole dream was so over the top I knew I was dreaming.  I had never had a dream like that before that I could remember.  Everything was so vivid, it reminded me of a serious vision I had after eating some cubensis.  It was like a story that didn't truly exist was unraveling itself in my mind.  I knew what was going to happen before it happened, probably because I knew it was a dream. </p><p>The part of the dream that makes me think it was a lucid dream was as follows.  I was at a festival looking for herb one minute, with two older dudes around 50 maybe, one who had just lost his foot that morning and now had a peg-leg wrapped in bloody bandages and had crutches.  They were following me because they thought since I looked like a hippie, I could find something to kill the pain.  I told them I didn't have any painkillers but they said that's cool, there was another thing that would kill the pain they knew I would find.  </p><p>So we kept walking around, and I saw this kid laying down and he had this T-shirt on that I have but have never seen anywhere else and I always wanted to see someone with it because there is a Rastafarian on it who I'm not sure if it's Peter Tosh or Bunny Wailer or anyone else for that matter.  So I stopped to ask him, and called for the dudes I was with to stop.  They said no and just kept walking.  I felt bad but I had to find out who it was on the shirt.</p><p>I looked closer at the shirt but his shirt definitely had Bob Marley on it, but the rest of the shirt looked the same.  He was totally friendly so I decided, in my dream, to ask him if he had any herb, because the guy I was with needed it especially for medical purposes.  Turned out, he had the best around.  But he was so excited it he yelled it out loud, so I immediately felt we should be in a more secluded place because this wasn't a music festival, and there were little kids and families around who I thought would get pissed.  So the next thing I knew we were in his house and he called upstairs to his girl to roll a fat one an bring it on down while we smoked a bowl downstairs.  Then she came down with a fatty.  I asked if I could take it with me to smoke with the dudes I was with.  They said sure.  I went to look for the dudes, but could not find them.  Some more things happened after that, but it didn't feel like I knew I was dreaming anymore.  I woke up soon after.  Now there was more before the festival but that was when I really felt like I was controlling what was going on.</p><p>To test if it was coincidence or that the substances really cause the dream, I tried it again the next night, but took 3 of each capsule instead of just to.  Crazy dreams again.  This time, though, realizing I was dreaming and controlling the dream did not coinside, much to my dismay.</p><p>I knew I was dreaming this time, because everything was just too beautiful where I was.  My girl and I were on a beach, there were crazy rock formations the water was blue-green and you could see all the way to the bottom.  But then, as we were sitting there, two guys came up behind us saying stuff like 'oh what a beautiful day' and whatnot in another language but I could still understand them.  Then this beautiful young girl comes up behind them with dark skin and dark hair and the best smile I've ever seen.  She took off her shirt like it was nothing and she was topless with a scant bikini bottom.  She had very small breasts but she was beautiful, not that my girl isn't beautiful, because she is, but it was one of those times where other girls look at a girl who is so gorgeous and so comfortable with herself that the other girls around start calling her a slut and stuff.  So that's what my girl did in the dream. </p><p>My girl and I went swimming then in the beautiful water.  After a while, she decided to get out but I wanted to stay in. I look back and see the nymphette girl coming my with that same smile as before.  I'm melting because she's coming right toward me.  She comes right up and pinches my side and starts touching me and telling me where we should go and what we should do.  </p><p>At this point, an experienced lucid dreamer would have remembered he was dreaming.  This was my second in two nights, so I am a novice and I forgot.  I, at this point, controlled myself and declined her seductive offer, because I said I could not do that to my girlfriend.  Had I remembered that it was a dream, I would've known that I wouldn't have hurt my girls feelings at all.  Damn, she was gorgeous! Oh well.</p><p>Then I remembered it was a dream again when things got crazy as I got out of the water. I took a few steps onto shore and ended up walking out the front door of my parents house to see my girl and my mom talking.  Then, the nymphette walked out the door from behind me right past us, and said 'hi' and my mom said to me 'aren't you going to introduce us?'  Then I just realized that I was dreaming again because my girl and my mom started laughing, and I knew it was because they knew that I knew it was a dream again and I could have done so many things with the nymphette had I realized it was a dream while I was still in the water.  Hey, at least it proves that I'm faithful to my real-life, loving girlfriend.  </p><p>So I think that maybe the combination of kava, passionflower, valerian, and holy basil causes dreams so intense and over-the- top, that you can realize you are in a dream.  I'm definitely going to do this again, probably many times until I get it right.  I'm also going to do some more research on lucid dreaming.  Hopefully I'll learn to fly, or be a super hero, or be able to become invisible or invincibile or something.  But most of all, I hope to run into the nymphette again.  And next time, I will be prepared.  Like a giddy boy scout his first time alone with a girl he's got a huge crush on!</p>"
