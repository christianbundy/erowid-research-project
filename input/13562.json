 "report": "<p>\nAll of my friends have done lage doses, (up to 100mg, which I dont recommend, although they love it), of AMT for the last half year or so off and on. I myself have been on the SSRI Celexa, so I could not try it myself. I decided to take myself off the medication. I got off the meds for 5 weeks and decided to try a low dose of AMT.</p><p>About 15 mg, i can't be exactly sure, but i had a 33mg pill, at least thats why my friend that sold it to me said, ad i split it in half into another gelcap.</p><p>T = 5:15 p.m. </p><p>Setting: Alone at home, music in background.</p><p>T + 1hr     Nothing yet, nothing but anticipation, almost everyone </p><p>            that i have read about said they got tweaked out. Not me</p><p>            I really had anticipation, i was nerveous, not tweaked.</p><p>T + 1.5hr   I feel a lightness to my step as i walk. It is very fun</p><p>            and intresting to just walk. And when i sit, i feel like</p><p>            i'm not quite touching the chair. This is quite fun.</p><p>T + 2       This is when i start to feel the results EXACTLY 2 hours</p><p>            after i took it, (to the min.). Many reports say that </p><p>            AMT crept up on them. This was not so with me, as i said</p><p>            i felt somthing different gradually, but the real effect</p><p>            came on like a switch in my brain. I found that every-</p><p>            thing that was once simple is now complex and </p><p>            wonderfully intresting, like i've never seen           </p><p>            it before. The shadows that my pen made as i worte down my</p><p>            thoughts as beautiful. I never did experience visuals,this </p><p>            disapoints me very much, but it was still fun. I did alot of  </p><p>            writing when i first felt the effects. </p><p>I wrote:</p><p>'Its like being high without the sense of confusion, everything is so clear' </p><p>Then i put down under that,</p><p>'Look at me, i'm quoting myself think, like i'm a reporter talking to my own brain'</p><p>I found a great sense of control over the amount of intoxication i felt. By focusing i could channel my thoughts into creative things, or just dream away into nothingness. This is a great feeling. My eyes were VERY dialated...very odd looking. i had hardly any color in my eyes, there was a huge pupil, and a small circle of color around that.</p><p>After the 2 hour mark it stayed like this for a half hour or so, and very gradually declined over into the morning. The only problem i had was a mild headache and a pain over my left eye. A frontal headache to be exact. I plan to try AMT at a higher dose nextime, maby 25mg, because i did not experience visuals. Talking on AMT is another thing i wish i got to do more, because i was alone i did not get to, but i did get a phone call, and i loved it. Talking to people is easy and you have great insight. I highly recommend AMT, but make sure you do not have conflicting medications.</p>"
