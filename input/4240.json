 "report": "<p>\n2:10pm  ~1mg (scale dust) insufflated. BURN! Much sweating, isolated to my cheeks. Feel a wave of wobbly heat come over me. Set aside the 10mg weighed amount for later.</p><p>2:20pm  Swallow of coke brings mild nausea. Check mirror... slight eye dilation. Definite tingly alteration of touch, but very mild. </p><p>3:10pm Still some sensations. outside colors were slightly intensified. I'm considering trying half or all of the 10 I weighed out and set aside.</p><p>4:10pm No longer any noticable alteration of any senses. With only that little bit, though, my sinuses are quite aggravated. Decide to delay additional experiment until later this evening.</p><p>-=-</p><p>6:03pm After a brief moment of internal opening circle, insufflated roughly half of the weighed out 10mg. Burn was a little less, but its still sharp and intense. immediate sense of quiver. sit it out for a few minutes with no strong sense of really 'taking off', but very into the music playing (pfly - short circuit -- any pfly just seems to fit with any material for me). Lots of sweat on my cheeks and forehead; dripping.</p><p>6:09pm I'm not dead yet. No real g-forces. Up the nose goes the other half. Within a few minutes, it starts coming on strong. Body load increases dramatically over the next 20 minutes. Adductors in my legs spasm uncontrollably (acetylcholine action?). I get similar spasms in my wrists and occasionally my abdomen. Its that common fluttery feeling of psilocyb but magnified several times over. Pfly's music takes on an otherworldly feel before ending.</p><p>6:30pm Continuing to come on strong. I moved around the house and felt taller by several inches. It was partly from holding myself more erect but also an exaggerated sense. Sinuses and back of throat filled with phlegm; burn just now subsiding. First twinge of queasiness, undoubtedly due to the overwhelming phlegm. </p><p>For the next hour plus, the intensity continued to build. Giving into it increased the altered perceptions; struggling against it diminished them (as I've found to be the case with many substances). Some open eye visuals began around 7pm; by 8, shadows had texture (lace; weave; corduroy-like). CEVs were especially strong and flowing with a great variety of geometries, ranging from kaliedescope intricacies to lava lamp type patterns. </p><p>I puked 2 or 3 different times during that hour. Very little bile or food/liquid; just big balls of white, puffy phlegm. Mmmmm. The puking was very gag-like, not an all-out purge like I get on other substances. The muscle tremors also continued to increase in frequency and intensity. It never got to the point of dibilitating me, but it was uncomfortable. I had serious second thoughts about the method of delivery I'd chosen.</p><p>Smoking cannabis during this period helped some with the nausea and added to the sensations.</p><p>Sat for a short while on the back porch enjoying dusk. Thoughts turned to family and friends and history. I remember being awed by the number of memories in my head and how I possibly stored them all, even when rarely or never accessed. </p><p>Upon returning inside just before 8pm, Jetsam handed me an old college  notebook of mine I hadn't seen in years. I sat down with it listening to  Shri Durga by dj Cheb i Sabbah. I marvelled at my old notes, remembering in detail each class. I was struck again by how many of those words were simply placeholders, never really playing any further role in my life. Occasionally, I'd come across a real gem and reel from the wave of thoughts of all the ways it had impacted my perceptions since; my life; me.</p><p>At some point I lost track of the book and got caught up in the music and just staring at stones and plants in the room. Even stronger came thoughts of how many variables are involved in any given instant of time/experience and how truly lucky I have been to have so many of them come together with any regularity in my life. I had visions of myself as the trunk of a tree (probably because I was staring blankly at a tree at the time ;] ) and how the experiences of the past were my roots, the variables of any given instant the dirt I stood in, and my future was in my branches. I was humbled by the immensity of it all, with my mind assigning names to roots and branches at the speed of light, unable to consciously examine but a few due to the overwhelming speed with which they came.</p><p>The music ended. My awareness of my surroundings returned.</p><p>Game 4 of the world series had started and I went in to see if it would interest me around 9pm. Actually, I found it fascinating from a mental acuity perspective. I was extremely anal about stats and current standings. I didn't make the connection to earlier thoughts at the time, but I was flying thru all the variables involved each time the ball moved. </p><p>By 11pm, I was distinctly over the peak and physically tired. I watched the end of the game until nearly midnight and tried to get some sleep. I laid awake for awhile before drifting off fitfully, awakening every half hour or so. Sleep was difficult (lots of tossing and turning, getting up and walking around a bit, etc.) until approximately 4am.</p><p>The effects, while extremely mild, were noticable the entire next day -- a mixture of hangover, sleep deprivation, and lingering chemical alteration. </p><p>In conclusion, I think 2c-e has the most potential as an analytical tool of any substance I've come across in recent years. I hope to conduct further experiments, but I don't think I'll be insufflating it again without good reason... the burn and the phlegm alone are too much of a price, let alone the body load (which, from what I've read, is not as much an issue when taken orally).</p>"
