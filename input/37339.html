I'm a pretty standard type of guy. I stand about 168 tall and weigh 70 kgs. I'm much fitter than average and try to lead a very active life. I'm currently 18 and attending University in Australia. I am not on any medication and I do not have any mental problems, nor do I have a family history of the such. I feel I shoud point at now that as a rule I have a high tolerance for most substances and I tend to crash reasonably hard from stimulants.<br><br>
About a year ago I began experimenting with substances - such as weed, much later E and Speed - I had already been a drinker for about 2 years prior, and in the typical Aussie fashion E I was binge drinking most weekends, although it never got out of hand.<br><br>
We (my friends) only drop E once a month or less to help maintain a healthy mind and avoid the negative effects. However, I, independant of the group, have developed quite an appreciation for Amphetamines, specifically Dexamphetamine. <br><br>
Often experimenting with amphetamines in combinations and situations. I have learnt during my experience that Dexamphetamine is a very pale comparison to real street speed. Dexies are very, very smooth and are very 'flexible'. By that I mean that each experience depends heavily on mindset, what activities your taking in, and surroundings. I find that they greatly enhance any emotions, and often manifest themselves phsyically. If I get scared or nervous on them, I get an awkward tingling through my body. If I am, for instance, flirting, I get a very pleasurable rush and if I'm with friends I often (though inconsistantly) feel more sociable.<br><br>
This report is about a solo 'trip'. It was the first day in weeks that I was home completely by myself (the way I like it ;) ) and I decided to take kill some time on dexies. I key reason today was to suss out the differences between snorting a large amount and eating a small, and snorting a small amount and eating a large. I was totally prepared for a completely relaxed day and my mindset reflected this. I woke up at 10:30, had some breakfast and took my dexies at 11. I snorted somewhere about 8 mgs of finely crushed powder and swallowed 20 mg. I then went outside and began to read my book in the warm shade. Summer in australia is hot and humid, and today was warm but very nice.<br><br>
After about 15 mins I was up and flying, however, as I was prepared and expecting a relaxing day, it was an incredibly smooth and enjoyable sensation. I became fully engrossed in my book and began thinking much more deeply and my thoughts flew off at tangents that I was usually unacustomed too. I felt extremely relaxed and content with life, the universe and everything. After about an hour I started with the ups &amp; downs (the 'frowns'). It is generally a feeling of being a bit bummed out, but I gradually rose back to a pleasurable high. It easy to fight these frowns and takes just a bit of mental work to overcome it.<br><br>
I finished my book in about 2 hours and then I found myself completely content to just sit and listen to the radio. I sat for about and hour and just chilled to my music and listen to the sounds of the birds and the life in my garden. At 1:45 I decided to snort 5 mg more to maintain my comfortable level. Then after doing a few trivial chores which normally would bother me, but didn't today. I found myself just sitting and listening to the radio again.<br><br>
I felt I should go do something slightly more constructive so I decided to document this 'trip'. It's now after 3pm and I find myself cruising with a nice body buzz, however, I'm not much above baseline. Normally my resting pulse is about 60 bpm but right now it's up around 90. I guess that would explain the buzz. I'm having a reasonably big cup of coffee to extend the upper out into the evening, when hopefully I'll want to just crash and sleep at about midnight.<br><br>
Important to note that from about 1:30 onwards I have had chronic pasties (dry mouth) and an annoying yet tolerable jaw clench, some of my family has also arrived home and so I've decided to spend the arvo in my room with my computer and radio.<br><br>
I definatly recommened the measured use of amphetamines, especially dexamphetamines. Dexies in particular are sometimes unpredicatable, though almost always enjoyable when I use them alone. They also making doing annoying Uni assignments enjoyable and incredibly easy - my thoughts for writing just flow, however, today I find my creativity lacking - sorry for the lack of wit in this experience report.<br><br>
For the record - As I've said, dexies are very smooth and subtle, and once I find myself at my 'peak' buzz I usually feel like taking more to push the feeling. I find them fun. Also, Dexamphetmine stays in my system a fair while as most of the pills are time release, so taking them after about 6 pm usually means I won't be getting much sleep that night. That is why daytime tripping is very relaxing, fun and usually has few negatives. Be aware however, I have found myself building up a mean tolerance. Today was a very mild dose for me, if I was to totally let loose I would want to take closer to 35 - 40 mgs. And I've done this substance about only a dozen times. It's a very quick curve for tolerance with this substance and my body.<br><br>
