About me: I'm a college freshman after about 1 month of classes. I've always been characterized as intelligent, but I really tend to procrastinate. It's hard for me to sit down and write a paper unless it's down to the wire. I've done plenty of drugs- psychedelics, opiates, various herbs, and stimulants. The stimulants I've done are Adderall, methylphenidate (Ritalin), propylhexedrine, levmetafetamine, and coca leaf.<br><br>
Experience:<br>
I slept 12 hours the night before the experience. I put off starting a large paper until 11, and I was starting to get pretty tired at this point. I casually mention to a friend that I wish I had some amphetamines to keep me awake, and he offers me some of his Vyvanse. I take one of his 50 mg pills and swallow it. I had eaten dinner about two hours earlier, but I didn't want to open it up and snort it, since I didn't know it's solubility. I start feeling the effects in about an hour. It started slow, not like a typical amphetamine at all. It felt more like I'd had about three cups of coca tea- it was more of a rounded motivation rather than a sharp spike in energy, like most other stimulants. Around this point, I ended up getting some diarrhea (I often do with amphetamines), and took two Imodium (loperamide). This shouldn't have effected the trip at all.<br><br>
After this, I really started to work. I lost all track of time. I remember thinking to myself, 'this is the best work experience I've ever had.' I notice my heart beating pretty strong, like it does on amphetamine. My roommate came back to the room at about 3:30, and I was still hacking out the paper. I ended up working on that until about 5, while listening to Mahler and Shostakovich (I wouldn't have been able to write the paper without music). My first class was three hours later, and my energy level showed no sign of dispersing, so I figured that I'd do some more work that was due the next day (I usually did it during the day). I ended up finishing at around 7:30 and taking a shower.<br><br>
In my first class, I first started to notice what is best described as a brain fog. It's hard to describe. I guess that I just didn't really care about anything other than what was going on in my head. I was definitely awake- more awake than I'd ever been for that class- but I wasn't acting more awake. I was acting pretty much the same. I felt an urge to talk, and contributed to discussions, but I was much less eloquent than usual- I tended to ramble on without saying anything. This wasn't like me at all. This was about 10 hours after I took the drug, and my heart was still beating strong.<br><br>
In my next class, I experienced my first lull in energy. I felt like I was about to nod off, but I was able to pay attention to the lecture. By the end of the class, I was determined to go back to the dorm and take a nap before my next class (I usually do that). I get back to the dorm, climb four flights of stairs, and my heart is beating again. I'm fully energized, and have no motivation to sleep whatsoever. This is about 13 hours after I took the Vyvanse. I figure, though, that I'll end up getting sleepy after theatre, so I make myself a cup of coca leaf tea to keep me going before heading off for my next class.<br><br>
In theatre, I'm more awake than ever. I do an improvised scene, and I lose all sense of both actor awareness and internal monologue. It was like my brain shut off, and my body was doing what felt right. At the end of the class, 15 hours after taking the drug, I still feel energized.<br><br>
I start getting exhausted in my next class. I end up nodding off for a bit, and alternate between nodding off and being engrossed by the material (math, which I often find interesting). By the end of the class, I'm determined to go back to the dorm and sleep for two hours before cheerleading. This is 18 hours after I took the drug. I go back and sleep for two hours, wake up, and am fully mentally awake. I call the coach and let them know that I pulled an all-nighter, was crashing, and won't be at practice. This wasn't entirely true. I was totally awake and wanted to be awake, but I just didn't want to lift people above my head.<br><br>
Right now, it's 7:45 PM. This is nearly 21 hours after the experience. I have no desire to sleep, and I still feel my heart is beating. I'm in a bit of a brain fog, though, and don't really feel any motivation to do any work. I can't imagine that it will last past 11 tonight, and if it does, I'm sure that I'll be able to fall asleep. Possibly with the help of melatonin.<br><br>
Summary: Vyvanse is a very long acting stimulant. It's more useful for working than Adderall, and it's definitely less jittery than any other stimulant I've tried. It's a wonder drug for the procrastinator, but given the duration, I'd expect that daily use would result in some bad side effects, like amphetamine psychosis. Also, after about 8 hours, there's a significant brain fog. But as far as getting papers done on short notice, there's nothing like it.<!-- End Body -->
