I have had a few drug experiences that stand out above the rest; I would like to share one with you now. First, a little background.<br><br>
At the time of this experience I was a junior in college. I began using drugs freshman year, and they basically changed my life. When this trip took place I had worked with marijuana, mushrooms, LSD, salvia and opium (I have since tried cocaine and DXM). From the first, drugs were entirely a spiritual guide, and they renewed and redefined my interest in meditation, energy work, etc.<br><br>
These shrooms were from my first attempt at growing. At all times during the growth cycle, I treated my shrooms with love and respect, sending them good energy at least once a day. It turns out this connection was repaid many times over.<br><br>
In preparation for this trip, I waited until for a night when all my suitemates would be gone. I made sure I had no outstanding obligations. I also spent the week prior doing extra meditation, especially Inner Smile and other Taoist energy techniques. The day of the trip I ate very little. Finally I was ready to begin. At 10:25, I ate 3.3 grams of my dried shrooms with a little honey (I really dont know why people hate the taste so much. A little bland, but not bad). I smoked about 1/4 bowl good indoor bud from my favorite piece. I find smoking really helps the trip. I then settled back, smoking a hookah and listening to Debussy.<br><br>
Around 10:55 I felt the onset. Usually it takes over an hour for me to come up, so I figured this would be unusually strong, but I wasnt prepared for what hit me: in literally five minutes, I went from almost baseline to an intense trip. I barely had time to walk three feet to my bed and lie down. For a few minutes, there were extreme color oddities, perspective hallucinations, etc. I quickly passed to tripping so hard that external vision sort of lost meaning. I sensed the rapid approach of a life force vaster than I could imaginethis was the Mushroom Consciousness. Then it embraced me<br><br>
and I instantly felt a divine love so powerful it blew my ego to pieces and scattered them across the cosmos. For a second I was frightened by this, and then I realized that trying to resist wouldnt work, so I <i>relaxed</i> and abandoned any shred of tension. I saw that this was the way I should always live - that I should always do what was absolutely natural. I saw beyond the confines of my lifetime, and I realized that my True Self was engaged in what Hinduism calls lila - deliberately forgetting my nature and assuming a mundane existence, solely for the experience of rediscovering my origins. I was so unbelievably thankful that I could spend eternity in this game of Bliss. I saw that no matter how hopeless life on earth seems, access to this cosmic love is literally right at our fingertips - all we need to do is genuinely ask for it. During the whole trip, it was obvious that these were all things I knew, but had just forgotten.<br><br>
The one visual that I had during this part was when I closed my eyes. I could see very clearly a huge, pulsating, fractal form, like a sea-anemone. It was made of different qualities of light, the astral analogy to color. I took this form to be the mushroom consciousness, and it showered me with beauty and peace.<br><br>
After about three hours, I came down quite rapidly. There were some lingering visuals, but they quickly faded. I went to sleep easily.<br><br>
A few thoughts: first, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that these experiences are far more real than everyday life. Everyone must reach his own conclusions of course, but the sheer intensity of this and similar experiences has removed my skepticism completely (and I used to be a hardcore atheist). Second, I think both the love I sent my shrooms while growing and the energy work I did prior to tripping were amplified by the shrooms, leading to my immensely positive experience.<br><br>
Even if you dont buy my New-Age spin, I strongly recommend mentally preparing by clearing your schedule, relaxing, avoiding distractions, etc. Finally, on a more general note (psychedelic righteousness alert) my journeys have taught me many things, but most importantly: this is it. This is not a movie, this is my life, NOW. Whatever I put into it is what you I get out. I was going to go off about reviving the 60s and ending war and all that, but Ill just end with this: if I approach the world with love, Iwill receive love in return.<br><br>
