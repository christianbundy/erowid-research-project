 "report": "<p>I only smoked cannabis once but it was such a negative experience that it still affects me now, 7 years later. For years after the experience, I suffered from acute anxiety and panic attacks that caused me to nearly become housebound. I suffered from paranoid thoughts, mostly to do with poisoning or drugging in my food or drink. I was obsessed with the idea that I was Schizophrenic or developing Schizophrenia. I could no longer trust my perceptions, in particular of sounds and my eyesight. I noticed every little detail such as the TV picture jumping or strange sounds and wasn't sure if this was just my imagination. I felt completely isolated in a way I never knew was possible, psychologically and emotionally unreachable. However, I researched my condition, had a small amount of counselling and now I feel that I am 99% healed. </p><p>The day after I smoked, I wrote down my experience:</p><p>We load up the pipe. Sarahs sitting on my toilet in my room at University and Im on the floor. This isnt working, I complain. We keep smoking. I feel totally normal apart from the fact that Sarah looks really odd from down here, like a hamster with huge cheeks. </p><p>Oh well, she says, Better luck next time mate. I laugh. But then her head looks really huge, like its behind a magnifying glass or on a TV screen. Help. Is this a dream? Somethings wrong so I get up. Sarah asks whats up, and I cant tell if she feels the same so I ask her. She tells me she doesnt and asks how I feel? Theres a hot feeling at the back of my neck, Im fading in and out of reality like a messed-up dream and everything is fragmented like pixalised squares going in and out of focus. </p><p>Sarahs lying to me, how can she not feel the same as me? Im repeating myself and I know this is beyond my control, Ive got to get out but I cant tell if the room is clear enough to open the door without setting off the smoke alarm. Sarah will know. She says its too smoky but I cant tell if shes lying. Then she says Ive fallen over and cracked my head on the sink and its bleeding everywhere. So thats why I feel so odd. Ive left my body and Im unconscious. Sarah puts her hands on the back of my neck and asks me cant I feel it? Although I know its her hands, I know its only her hands whilst Im unconscious and that in reality what I can feel all warm on the back of my head is my own blood. But although I know I am on the floor unconscious, I also know that she is lying, but then again I cant work out if she really is lying or if Im unconscious and its at this point that I realise I am going to believe everything she says, so I beg her not to say anything else bad. For the rest of the trip I feel like I am in a dual reality, separated from my body.</p><p>I need to phone somebody.</p><p>I phone my Dad, Ive smoked too much weed and I cant tell whats real and whats a dream. His response will be vital, he is the only element of truth and rationality apart from Sarah, but she keeps lying.</p><p>Well you cant tell anyway, he says.</p><p>Everything goes messed-up and hazy  it must be a dream or he would have made sense. Im really scared now.</p><p>How long will before this goes away, Dad?</p><p>A few hours.</p><p>He tells me that weed is much more speedy than solids and I wonder if my heart is beating really fast so I ask him and he says It shouldnt do, but he thought for too long so I can tell hes part of the conspiracy and hes lying too. Dad tells me that if I cant cope with a little bit of dope then I should never drop any acid. I then start to wonder if maybe someone laced the weed with acid as this is only meant to be a little bit of dope but it feels like a huge load of something nasty.</p><p>I want to go to sleep but Ive realised that what nobody else knows is that the weed has triggered off schizophrenia and Im going to be like this forever. The only way I can escape is to kill myself but I dont want to do that. I need air. I can only go if Sarah will let me, so I pretend Im normal so she will take me and she does. We start walking but I realise I cant remember how I got to the end of the road so I must still be in bed, but then I know Im not so I say wed better go back. Im scared Im going to fall over. I think about the knife in my kitchen and I know that Sarah is going to ask me to kill myself and I wont be able to say no because shes my only link to reality.</p><p>We get back and I need the toilet. I cant tell if my thoughts are really in my head or if Sarah can hear them and I look at her and I can tell shes pretending she cant hear </p><p>what Im thinking but I know she can.</p><p>Sarah says she needs to go to her room and goes outside. I hear a blokes voice saying Is this her first time? and I know that Sarah has gone and got some paramedics or drugs counsellor or something. I look outside for the ambulance but theres nobody there. Its because theyre hiding. Sarah comes back. Theres someone with her, I look in the corridor and ask: whove you brought with you?</p><p>Nobody, she lies. </p><p>I cant see anybody but thats because theyre hiding, so I pretend I believe her. Theyve told her how to act so I wont freak out. She sits and offers me a biscuit. No thanks. But she keeps asking me so I know I mustnt eat one. How come shes so calm? When are the authorities going to come and take me away? Maybe Im in some psychotherapists office and there are people trying to bring me back to reality. I need sleep. I want Sarah to stay so Ill be safe but she says she needs to sleep in her own room. She says shell leave her door open and mine so it will be okay. But Im scared theyre going to get me. I agree, however, in case I choke on my tongue or something.</p><p>Im alone and I know if I dont go to sleep I will never get back to reality, but I cant sleep. My rational mind starts to tell me that its okay, its just drugs and Ill be okay in a few hours, but I know its part of the conspiracy and is lying and that what it and nobody else realises is that this is no ordinary trip. Ive gone schizophrenic.</p><p>I can feel a burning in my lungs and I realise that theres a lump of weed resin stuck all along my windpipe and Im never going to recover because every time I breathe, I breathe more weed. I need to drink some water but the glass is near my knife and Im scared I might cut my wrists. I control this long enough to get water.</p><p>I go to the toilet but when I get up to flush the loo, theres a bit of weed floating in the water, and I think: Oh my God, its fallen out of me! Im full of weed!</p><p>I try to go back to sleep. But I keep on needing the toilet and every time I go I cant tell if Im on the toilet or if Im really in bed still. Also I cant tell if this is the same as last time and I feel stuck in a never-ending cycle of going to the toilet. Every now and then I see a glimpse of reality and I know I havent lost it completely and that it will come back. I feel that if I accept that I am not afraid of dying then this experience wont be so scary, so I say Im not afraid and actually its alright to be unconscious on the bathroom floor and dying. But then Im still terrified.</p><p>Reality starts coming back in larger pieces and I try really hard to hold onto it. I know Im going to be okay but my irrational mind still thinks Im crazy and that Ill be like this forever.</p><p>Eventually I fall asleep and in the morning when I wake up things seem relatively normal. Except that for about a week, I cant quite tell if people are telling the truth about totally normal, innocent things.</p>"
