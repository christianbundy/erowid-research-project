 "report": "<p>A few weeks ago I was heading to a coffeshop to write a paper with a couple of friends, around 10:00 PM, when a guy known to us to sell Adderall on occasion wandered by. My friend, Lincoln, who had been without sleep for some time already and was desperate to get his paper done asked him if he was selling and bought a 20 milligram pill from him.</p><p>I had heard about Adderall, it being quite popular at the college I attend and decided to get one for myself. While I smoke weed and drink regularly, I had zero experience with stimulants at the time, but went ahead and crushed and snorted half of the pill and parachuted (which involves wrapping the substance in toilet paper and swallowing it) the other half in the coffeeshop bathroom.</p><p>For about fifteen minutes I didn't feel much; I was a little up, maybe the equivalent of a couple of cups of coffee. Then as we sat outside writing our papers I suddenly realized that I had tons of energy and Lincoln and I decided to have an impromtou dance-off. I continued writing my paper and was completely focused, writing like a madman, and it was quality stuff, the words coming to me so easily. I went inside to get coffee and ended up just talking to a couple of people I had never met, any sort of awkwardness completely eliminated.</p><p>Right as the coffeeshop began to close at midnight I finished my paper with a blistering conclusion that tied the whole thing together and we headed back to campus. My friends had yet to finish their papers so I called up another friend, and went and smoked some weed in his car. We split a bowl of very good weed and at that point the effects of the Adderall were greatly intensified. I was constantly flipping through the cases of CDs in his car looking for music over and over, almost compulsively and talking intensely with him about music, which, probably more due to the weed than anything else, my enjoyment of was intensified.</p><p>Up until this point I slowly perceived that I had become a better, more idealized version of myself. I was highly social, ideas and thoughts rushing through my head, I was never at a loss for a thing to say. When the weed combined with the Adderall, however, my thoughts sped up to the extent that I didn't even want to bother talking to my friend because the thoughts and conversations that were going on in my head were going so fast that talking would have been confusing. I instead grabbed a piece of paper and began writing anything that came into my head as quickly (which was not anywhere near quickly enough) as I could. My friend, perhaps prompted by my lack of sociability decided to go bed, and I went and looked up Lincoln.</p><p>By this point my lassitude caused by the weed had mostly worn off and I was again the sociable, witty, manic version of myself, and it occurred to me: I really like being this way. If I could be like this all the time, that would be great! Admittedly, this was a worrisome thought to me, because it's thoughts like that that lead to addiction, but I pressed on and found Lincoln in his room. At that point we were both manic and elated and decided to become blood brothers. After completing that transaction, we decided to go to Waffle House at about 2:30 AM.</p><p>We ended up watching the sun rise from that Waffle House. Lincoln and I spent five hours drinking cup after cup of coffee and chain smoking cigarettes. Most of all however, we talked, with the waiters, other patrons but mostly with each other. We had an intense five hour conversation with absolutely no breaks in it, because with the ideas rushing through our heads we had something to talk about queued up before the other finished talking. Around 7:30 we headed back to campus, went to class. The high tapered off and I crashed at about 10:30 AM, with all the good effects gone, and a great weariness overtaking me. Tired as I was, however, I wasn't able to sleep until that night.</p><p>The night I first took Adderall was probably one of the most uniquely enjoyable I've ever had, and I definitely liked it too much, but I haven't become addicted and have no intention of allowing myself to do so. I got an A on that paper.</p>"
