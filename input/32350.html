It was a Friday night and instead of simply smoking a few bowls as a friend and I had planned, we headed to my college to shroom. We ate as soon as we got there, and other than my friend and I, no one had as many as 4 grams.<br><br>
It only took a good 15 minutes before I started feeling them. We were outside smoking a bowl of weed and I noticed all the bricks of the house were jutting out of the house, like little tetris bricks. We headed back inside and took a seat in the living room, ready to watch Spy Kids 3D on a big screen. Now and then I would fade in and out of understanding anything the movie was saying. I started thinking, is everyone else seeing what I'm seeing? Is anyone alive in this room? Am I alone? I took off my 3D Glasses and turned around. I was horrified. Everyone looked the same in their glazed over stares with their glasses on. I yelled at them, I stared at them, I gave them the finger, I shouted profanities, nothing worked. I admitted defeat and went outside for a smoke.<br><br>
I heard the world become a little quieter... I stood there by myself, wondering what had just happened. I felt a fear inside of me, I couldn't head back inside. I went to the street and played hackeysack with myself. I wanted a car to come racing around the corner and run me down. I wanted to feel the insides of my body coming out. It never came. I headed back and felt everything *alive* around me. I headed inside and laid down on the floor again. I stared up at the ceiling and felt like my body was rising up with the air. I lost myself for a good 20 minutes and then everyone headed outside to smoke.<br><br>
We smoked a joint and talked for awhile, all the while laughing nonstop. It didn't even matter what was happening, we couldn't stop laughing. Headed back inside. The movie was on for a bit longer, but I had lost the ability to concentate on it. I had stopped wearing 3D Glasses at this point, as I didn't see the need for them. Everything seemed somehow more dimensional then it was before. The movie ended and music was put on. I retired to the kitchen to try and make some sense of how I was feeling. No such luck. I spent awhile trying to understand what everyone was talking about, but I routinely spaced out and felt like my mind was being bubbled up inside my brain. Every now and then I would hear something that would bring a 'POP' to my head and I'd phase back in, behind the conversation.<br><br>
I headed outside once more, to smoke a bowl. I smoked and proceeded to stare at the brick wall again. It had some sort of feeling pouring out of it. I had to touch it. I felt like if I did, I would be able to make some sense of why it existed. I came inside and did the same with the straw walls. They seemed so odd, so out of place. I wanted to reach across and touch every part of the wall, every contour. It felt so alive. I finally gave up and sat down, trying to relax and calm down for the eventual drive home.<br><br>
4 grams is a different trip from 3 for me. It has a lot more confusion and a lot of struggling to find reasoning behind things. I have shroomed before when I was off anti-depressants and I found I hallucinated more. On the effexor and valproic acid, I found myself very confused, yet having a good time. An enjoyable trip, but leaves many questions unanswered.<!-- End Body -->
