Maybe if I had gotten my two tabs of acid I would never have gone on this stupid rampage I call a trip.  My friend 'Pete' and I had been informed that our money had been stolen by someone.  We originally had someone go to the city (New York) to get the acid for us.  Unfortunately someone had taken our money.  So after learning about this two days later we decided to go into town via a ride from Pete's dad.  This was also the night we decided to take the next step and buy enough Dramamine to start seeing stuff.  We had done this before, but with only 12 tablets, enough to get us messed up.  Anyway, after obtaining the four tubes (Pete had forgotten that 12 tablets were in the tube) we took a tube each and a couple extra.<br><br>
When we were done taking the pills we decided to go to Pete's friend Fred's house to get some weed.  We got to the house, and asked for the weed.  Fred was already stone, or it seemed like it, so he had no dispute about it.  Pete had taken two hits from a waterfall.  I only took one, as I did not want to over-do the whole experience.  It was a good thing that I had stopped at one.  After talking about nothing for about thirty minutes, though it seemed like two hours, we decided to get up and go on our merry way.<br><br>
By this point I had felt like I was about 300 pounds and couldn't stand up straight.  I was also told that I looked really bad.  I didn't want to go out of Fred's yard because of the weed high gave me extreme paranoia.  I couldn't keep a train of thought for over five seconds so anything that needed an explanation was forever trapped in a whole lot of 'ummm''s.  When I do these types of drugs I get quiet so I had not told Pete of my not wanting to go outside of the yard.  So we treaded on out of Fred's yard.  This is when it all went sour.<br><br>
I honestly do not know how we got there, but we were in someone's driveway.  Apparently, someone from the neighborhood had told the resident of the house that we were 'rummaging through his things in the garage' which I was honestly not doing.  I remember looking at his car, but that's it.  Maybe Pete had been going through his things, but I was not.  The man came out rather angry, and I believe he was under the influence of alcohol, as his speech was rather inflammatory and was slured a bit.  After being told that we didn't have the right to go into people's yards he asked us what we were on.  I guess he was serious in asking us as he looked at me and said I didn't look 'so hot.'  I commented that I was tired, trying to look as innocent as possible.<br><br>
From there I do not remember how, but I tried getting back to Fred's yard, while Pete was standing there with the home owner.  The home owner had yelled at me to come back over to him, yet again telling me that I don't have the right to go into people's yards.  I didn't mention the fact that Pete knew him, as I didn't want to get Fred in trouble.  He then asked us to stay here for awhile, which I thought rather contradictory, as he didn't want us anywhere near his yard.  I then realized that he had called the police.  Pete had sullenly said 'Well, Trent, the cops are coming.'  I looked over to the man rather angrily, and he nodded his head.<br><br>
I don't know how long it was till the police came, as I had no comprehension of time.  I can say one thing though.  I had not seen so many police for just two people under the influence ever.  So after asking the man what the problem was the police promptly asked us what we were on.  I said that I had taken Dramamine.  They seemed rather confused, further proving that police around here know nothing about Drug Use other than marijuana.  From there I remember them calling into the station reporting that we had the ability to obtain pot, cocaine, alcohol, and other mind altering substances.  I laughed at this, and a rather stout officer pushed me into a tree asking if what the person said was funny.  I don't know if I explained why I laughed or not, but I do know that he asked me to empty my pockets.  I did so, and when he asked me if I had anything on me I said no, only these cigarettes.<br><br>
That is when he pushed me over to the squad car and told me to lean on it with my hands while he patted me down.  I guess they don't take underage smoking lightly.  When they didn't find anything on me, they lead me to the squad car and told us that there was to be no talking about five times.  After another officer had seen us in the car he repeated the rule of no talking like we were having a conversation over tea in there.<br><br>
We had arrived at the station before I knew it.  I don't remember walking into it, but I got there nonetheless.  They further interrogated me on what we planned for the night.  They called my parents and also Pete's parents before taking us to the hospital.  The paramedics were also not very nice to us as they insisted that we were on something else other than the two previous said drugs.  I finally got to the hospital and they took my blood pressure, which was off the charts.  I could also feel my heart beating out of my chest.  After having to stare at my parent's cold, disappointed eyes for minutes, the doctor came and prepped me for the ordeal.  He also told me to piss in the cup to have a drug test.  They still didn't believe that we were only on two drugs.<br><br>
After awhile doing nothing but sitting in my bed the doctor came with an IV set and a glass of charcoal and water.  I was forced to drink the whole thing.  Afterwards he came with an odd-looking tube with a bag at the end.  He then proceeded to shove it up my urethra.  Never, had I witnessed so much pain in my life.  After it was done, he left for awhile.  I had looked at my watch and it was only 11.  After falling asleep, or thinking I did, I had waken up to another doctor explaining to me long-term effects of the drug, like paralyzation of the muscles that make you pee.  They then took the tube out of my urethra.  It burned when I peed for two more days afterwards.  I left the hospital at three, knowing the fact that Pete had not been so lucky.  He was not snapping out of it.  I still have not heard from him.  <br><br>
When I look in the mirror I do not see my old self.  I see a second self.  I feel different too.  I do not have the same mentality that I had last week.  I could face charges of trespassing and could be sent to juvy.  I write this not to deter you from using this drug.  Only you can make the choice of taking it or not.  I do urge you though, if you decide to experiment with this drug, please do it at home, and not in the middle of the town.  You just might have the bad trip that I had experienced.<!-- End Body -->
