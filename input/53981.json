 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: This report is marked as a 2C-E report, but readers should be aware there are aspects of it that suggest the identification is speculative.] </p><p>I bought 2 hits of what I though was LSD but I soon found out it was 2C-E.  I bought the 2 hits for a festival that me and a friend of mine were attending.  I noticed that this was a strange form of LSD because it was in a clear capsule with white powder in it and I weighed the powder and in one capsule there was 30mg and in the other there was 10mg.  I gave my friend the 10mg and I took the 30 mg one.  About an hour later we were just standing there and my friend was smiling and having a good time and then all of a sudden he just falls down.  </p><p>I pick him up and his eyes start rolling in the back of his head and he got stiff as a board and started having a seizure and foam was coming out of his mouth and he just fell backwards and started shaking.  So then I picked him up and got him over the fence and then the security took him from there and got him in an ambulance. He had a seizure for 3 minutes and he had no pulse at all.  He almost died from this RC and it was one of the saddest things I have seen in my entire life.  He lived and he is ok and I told him that I would report this since I havent seen any other reports of this happening on 2C-E.  </p><p>If he did not get medical attention right away he would be dead im sure of it.  If we would have done it together at home or something with no medical assistance at the time I dont think he would have made it.  I handled my dose fine and I probably would have enjoyed it, if it wasn't for that happening to my friend.</p>"
