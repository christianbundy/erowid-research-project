 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trip began at my house so the setting was definitely a calm one. I had just gotten off work and picked up A. from her place. She had a bit of a cold but was otherwise in a good mood, I was a bit tired but felt well other than that. This was A.'s first time taking MDMA and we wanted it to be a good time. The pills I acquired where 'White Stars'- supposedly quite good pills. We took the pills at about 10 P.M. and began watching a movie. About 45 minutes through the movie A. was feeling nothing and I was feeling mild body tingles as the pills always hit me first before anyone else. The feeling was definitely MDMA like although it seemed slow to get moving. It reminded me of MDE actually, although I will probably never know for certain. After the movie we decided to supplement with about 1 ml of GBL because she still wasn't feeling much and it was already like 11:30. I also decided to eat about 2 grams of mushrooms because I always wanted to try a psychedelic and an empathogen at the same time.<br>We took the GBL and then hopped in the shower cause we were both getting some body chill effects. In the shower the effects kicked into high gear. The water felt amazing especially when the heat was turned up. A. said she felt lighter, like her body was less heavy. After the shower we had sex twice, which felt amazing. GBL definitely adds more of a sexual feel to the MDMA tactile effects. During the second time of having sex the mushrooms kicked in. The visuals where much more reality centered than on mushrooms alone. I saw visions of video game characters and friends and objects from my life. I also felt like I was able to dissociate my consciousness from my body at will, an effect that is very hard to describe except that thoughts seem to become more real than reality. <br>After we were done fooling around we lay in bed. The visuals overtook me with patterns and blobs of light, and a giant centipede I have seen a few times while tripping. I felt very lazy like I didn't want to move yet more functional than on mushrooms alone.  The emotional feelings of MDMA where there but they had been taken into a much more intellectual light. I was able to look at and analyze my feelings and thoughts. I realized some of the consequences of my actions and felt I needed to change some things in my life. I think this combination would be more useful for therapy than MDMA alone because on MDMA the feelings can sometimes overwhelm the mind, this combination made me feel like my thoughts about my emotions where less subjective than on MDMA by itself.  The MDMA also seemed to keep the psilocybin in check and prevent it from becoming too frightening or chaotic. I also think I made the right choice in taking the mushrooms after the ecstasy, as the come-down from the mushrooms is much more mild than the comedown from MDMA<br>There were only a few things that were annoying about the trip. The typical jaw clench effects of the MDMA where exacerbated by the psilocybin and felt very weird. Also since both the MDMA and psilocybin lasted longer than the effects of the GBL, I got to feel the comedown from GBL and the subsequent dopamine rebound effect while tripping and rolling, which caused some unpleasant heart racing. Also at some points during the trip I became so enthralled by the visuals I forgot I had a body and when I remembered I got a few unwarranted frights that I had stopped breathing. <br>The next day we woke up completely energized. I felt great, there was absolutely no hangover, which was a surprise because I have gotten MDMA hangovers the last couple times I tried it. Overall I greatly enjoyed the combination of MDMA and psilocybin especially for its self-therapy effects.  The GBL was also a nice addition for the tactile effects although I would skip out on it unless you plan on having sex.\n\n\n"
