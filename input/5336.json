 "report": "<p>I have been interested in dreaming for several years now, ever since I first read Carlos Castenada. I have also suffered from recurring bouts of insomnia for several years. having tried numerous RX sleep aids (ambien, trazodine, benedryl...) I started to try melatonin. This alone seemed to do nothing, especially at the 3mg dosage provided, which accoriding to Shulgin is way too low to produce effect (especially in a western mind which always seems to need more of somethng to feel it working). </p><p>At the same time I also was trying out L-Tryptophan 500mg tabs for sleep as well. Eventually, I came to take both before bed. I believe I was taking 2500 mg L-Trptophan and 15 mg melatonin. Not only did the combination of these two produce a pronounced drowsiness and eventually a deep sleep, but after several nights I began to notice that I was remember more dreams than normal. </p><p>I have tried this combo in several different dosage levels, going as low as 500mg L-Tryptophan and 3 mg melatonin and have still noticed the pronounced dreaming effect. The only drawback however, is that in the morning I feel a heavy sedation that is sometimes hard to shake off, an almost 'drugged' feeling (which Trazodone always produced in me). </p><p>I figured this info might be interesting for those who have been experimenting with Calea Z...sweet dreams.</p>"
