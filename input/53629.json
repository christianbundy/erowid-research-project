 "report": "<p>I started off with 16 mg. My boyfriend (R) had taken 16mg with a very intense trip, and considering I usually have harder trips than others I decided to split the dose with him, each of us taking 8 mgs. We took it at night, which may have been the first mistake, as I soon learned what a wonderful thing the sun is. The come up started when we were in the basement. Everything started moving, everything. </p><p>We then proceeded over to his dorm. The lights shot off beautiful fragments, and I could hear every step in the grass clearly. When we got there we decided making out was the appropriate move. However 2c-p links the body and mind on very psychological levels. I believed that he was grape juice and I a cup and that he was pouring into me. I then thought my skin was the night sky and that I was covered in stars. Then that I was Cleopatra and could travel to Africa (located on my hip) by simply turning around. I felt very connected to women in history. All the while rings of electricity were singing up my body, and I had to pause to breathe.</p><p>I think the trip would have gone better, except that his roommate and roommates girlfriend were both asleep in the room, their presence making me uncomfortable. Knowing that R had had a difficult trip before with this drug, I started to worry about him. It seemed like he kept leaving the room, but I'm still foggy on that. I do remember suddenly being stricken with fear because I didn't believe it was R that was kissing me. I worried because it seemed that like I could be anyone so could he and that the person I had known had left leaving an animalistic man in his wake. When I looked into his eyes, it was as if he was a different person or not a person at all. </p><p>A tad later I ended up alone on the bed, and because it is lofted thought the ceiling was coming done on me. I got down close to the mattress, terrified of the ceiling. R came back, but because I was still unsure it was him I didn't really trust him that the ceiling wasn't getting closer. According to him I sat there in silence for some time. Apparently I slept.</p><p>The next day (a few hours later) I was very cautious. I looked out the window for some time captivated by the math and beauty involved with the natural world. I talked very little to the guys, because while they played video games it was as if they spoke in square language while I spoke in circle language. I toyed with the idea of becoming nihilistic, and stood outside in the rain and wind with a black umbrella, and that seemed to bring back my senses, though some things still trigger those intense feelings, such as the shirt R was wearing, other 2cs, and the basement walls.</p>"
