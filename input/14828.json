 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nPrologue:<br>As a 15 year old, I have up to date tried 20 substances + with much gained. I'm sure you've read my DXM HPPD report. DXM as a psychedellic was intriguing, but I found a different love with tryptamines. I had odered a pack of around 70 A. colubrina seeds. After many failed experiments roasting,smoking and snorting the seeds, I decided to take advice from 'Persistant'.<br>Preperation:<br>Syrian Rue:<br>I ground roughly 3g of Syrian Rue seeds to a fine powerder. I then placed the powder in 1 cup of boiling water, which also had 1 tbs. of vinegar(acetic acid). I let the mixture boil with occasional stirring for 10 minutes. I then strained the contents through a paper towel into a measuring cup. I mesured roughly 50ml of extracted liquid. I then mixed it with grapefruit juice and other fruit juices to hide the nasty taste.<br>A. Colubrina: <br>The seeds were placed in a wet paper towel and then placed in a teperware container for 1hr. Then seeds were removed and cut up with a knife. I then let them air dry on a saucer for 6hrs. <br>Procedure:<br>I drank the Syrian Rue extract around 1hr. before munching on the A. colubrina (big mistake, uughhh). I suggest using a chaser with the mashed seeds.<br>Experience: <br>I first felt the effects of the Rue. I had eaten quite a bit of food before so I wasn't sure how the experience would be effected by this. I retreated to bedroom where I felt an odd body sensation. I was starting to experience nausea and cramps. I enjoyed the effects of the Rue and some CEVs associated with it. Then it took and odd turn. The Rue shifted gears, I was aware this would happen. I was feeling quite sick so I ran to the bathroom. I layed half on the floor and against the wall. The 5-MeO was begining to take effect. The colour of the room started changing - from bright to dark. Hazes of coulours appeared everywhere. I noticed more CEVs. <br>Syrian Rue usually makes me tired, but stangely enough I was feeling quite stimulated. This must be due to the 5-MeO interaction I'm guessing. I watched the floor breath and admired the colours of the CEVs. <br>I was feeling better so I dicided to go on IRC. I chated and watched visualsation web sites. I was astounded by the visualsations. I wasn't acting myself, I was altered sort of like a 12g Morning Glory experience. I watched some Amazon Flash movies and this effected the experience. <br>I lost complete tack of time. I decided to go to bed. I put on a Fear Factory album and watched the Amazon patterns on the wall. This was amazing! The figures were fluresent and geometric. <br>I was getting alot of cramps and feeling nauseated. So I decided to give in to the nausea. I threw up alot in the bathroom but it didnt bother me that much. I attracted the attention of my dad. I made up some cheap excuse for the puking. I then went to bed for good and slept till the next morning without disturbance.<br>Epilogue:<br>I will definetly try this combination again. Probly with most of the remaining seeds. I plan to take maybe 20-30 seeds with 6g of Rue. I want to wait abit though. I'm very glad this worked and I thank 'Persistant' for his methods, they proved very helpful.\n\n\n"
