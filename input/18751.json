 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nIt had been a while since I last used mushrooms, so I was feeling a strong urge to trip again. This time, however, I wanted to trip alone. I've heard that solo trips are much more spiritual, generally, than trips with friends. So, I go to my friend who recently went shroom hunting and buy a quarter off him. The week goes by, and finally it's Friday night.<br>I decided to take the shrooms around 10pm, so I could safely go outside without being seen by anyone. The time comes, and I chew up an 1/8 ounce, thinking this is all I would need. However, an hour went by and I felt nothing, beside the sort of spaced-out feeling you get with shrooms. I decide to eat the other 1/8 and smoke a bowl of some sativa schwag, just to 'jump start' the trip. About 15 minutes after eating the second 1/8 and smoking the bowl, the effects kick in. Hard. I look around the room and everything is growing and shrinking, breathing and morphing. The patterns on the bedsheet start shifting and moving around. I can't focus on anything at all, I just stare mindlessly at the room.<br>Suddenly, I had a great surge of energy, and decided to go outside. However, I was having a difficult time walking. I ended up walking like a bloated fat person just to safely get myself downstairs. When I got to the door, I saw my two cats eagerly awaiting to go outside. I smiled uncontrollably at the two furry creatures, and released them from the confines of my kitchen. They run outside, and I stumble along behind them. This is where everything went insane. It's been around 30 minutes since I ate the second 1/8, even though it's felt like two hours.<br>Have you ever been to a rave and seen people liquid dancing? That's essentially what I was doing, only it was uncontrollable. The only way for me to walk was by liquiding around. I liquided around outside for a few minutes, then I looked down on the patio about 10 feet in front of me and noticed a tiny, baby pill bug. I was extremely fascinated by it, and got down on the ground and squirmed my way over to it. I pick it up and start talking to it, letting it walk over my hand. It converses back to me, asking me what I'm doing. We talk for a few hours, in reality a few minutes, then I set it down and stand up again.<br>My cats had wandered off about 50 feet away from me, so I decide to go play with them. I liquid over to them, get back on the ground and start rolling around. They get curious and come up to me, rubbing their heads against mine and purring extremely loudly. Again, I felt an uncontrollable surge of happiness, and I start laughing. I stand back up and they walk away, heading toward the street. I lost focus of them and started looking at the pool.<br>The water had become alive, every particle shimmering with energy. My eyes get locked on the water, when I suddenly heard a dead leaf roll by. I become intensely interested in this leaf, and follow it with my eyes as it flows gently along it's path. It ends up going down to the street, to where my cats are. I decided to risk it, hoping no one was outside, and liquided my way down to my cats again. All this while, ever since I went outside, I've been breathing VERY VERY deep and loudly, just to feel the cool air rubbing against my lips, going into my mouth and lungs, and to hear the noise it makes while doing so. My cats are playing, chasing each other around the yard. Suddenly, I felt like I was a cat, so I got down on my hands and knees and started chasing them around. They weren't scared at all, and let me enjoy their little game. <br>It's been about an hour since the effects kicked in. It felt like it had been longer, but I know that's due to the drug. Suddenly, I sat down on the side of the street, and look at the trees. They formed an intricate, continuously moving and evolving fractal pattern. I lay back and look up at the sky, listening to all the noises, watching the clouds gently fly over. I could HEAR the universe. I could hear the atmosphere shifting and moving and bending and breaking, as the earth hurled through space. As I was lying on the ground, I felt as if I was in the very front of the earth, as if I was controlling it's flight through the cosmos. I felt like the earth was my backpack, my engine, guiding me through the heavens.<br>I laid there for what I believe was about an hour, although, again, it felt much longer, absorbing the universe into me. Eventually, I remember that my cats are still outside, and decide to find them to let them back inside. It was also getting very cold outside, and my fingers were numbing up. I felt a connection to the world as I've never felt before, and I wished to never leave the outdoors, yet I felt that I had to go back inside, for myself and for my cats. So, I liquid my way back up, and I see my cats waiting for me to let them back inside. I open the door, step in, and close it again. The noise of the world was suddenly gone, replaced by a warm, strangely comforting silence. I stumble back upstairs and plop down in front of my computer, to message anyone I possibly could about the experience I had. Only one of my friends was on, so I decide to message him. However, the only thing I could say was 'I exisssst'.<br>Gradually I come down, listening to Bhudda Bar and Shpongle. The trip lasted only around 4 hours, but it was very intense, very enjoyable.\n\n\n"
