 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI dissolved 500mcg of 25C-NBOMe (2C-C-NBOMe) in 25 units of water and found a vein easily without the need of a tourniquet. I pulled back and saw a plume of red then plunged slowly. Within 10 seconds I was in a place that would usually take an hour or so to get to with 600 or 700mcgs.  I measured out a dose for my friend to take nasally and could barely do it because my vision was starting to become quite busy.  But I managed, and as I finished and he dosed, I felt a surge and could tell the payload had made it to my brain. \r\nAs I purged into the trash can with such force it hurt my abs, I could see blue, purple, and chrome orbs projecting upward and floating away every time I contorted and spewed barf.  After about 3 or 4 minutes of barfing, it was over and the nausea, which I have never felt before, not even off of 1500mcg nasal or oral, disappeared too. I had eaten right before I dosed and totally underestimated the physical effects since I had never experienced anything physical except for pleasant body high and electric chills off my nasally dosed trips.  This came on so fast that the slight shakes I'll have sometimes when coming up on a heavy dose of any strong tryptamine or phenethylamine was just so much stronger, I was literally shaking for at least the first 20 minutes. But I covered myself with a big blanket and that seemed to calm it down quite a bit.  \r\nThe first 20 minutes felt like hours too; it was quite a long long time and it was extremely noticeable to both me and my friend tripping how fucking long it was in just those first few minutes.  During this first hour of the trip, I experienced the strongest visuals by far. I decided to turn the lights out and turn off the tv because it was just too much distraction. I had my friend do it though because I was essentially stuck to the couch. I remember looking at the blinds next to me a few times and they were by all normal definitions completely alive and rippling and enveloping inward and expanding back out continuously. Looking at my entertainment center, all the blue and yellow LEDs were surrounded by ambient, continuously morphing light. Everything around me was moving and didn't slow down until about 40 minutes later.  \r\nI got a lot more comfortable after that and the next 2 hours were quite strong and I laughed basically throughout the whole thing, laughed until my face hurt. Shpongle and Sponge Bob were extremely entertaining.  I remember going to piss and seeing what looked like the mushrooms on the cover of my copy of 'Food of the Gods' were all growing up off the book onto the tank of the toilet.  Interestingly, I have experienced this exact same visual the last time I dosed as well; it was quite a thing to watch as I pissed and tried to aim my stream in the continuously shrinking bowl. \r\nAt the 2 hour or so point, I felt like I was coming down, which was strange. Compared to my sublingual/nasal trips, this was a lot shorter. By the 3rd hour, I would say I was down enough to do anything I could do in a sober state, but I still wouldn't want to.  \r\nAt the 4th hour, my girlfriend drove my friend home and I rode along, and even though my stomach was pretty torn up from earlier, we decided to get some tacos from Taco Bell and I had a Meximelt and felt fine.  Got home, smoked a few bowls over the course of a few hours, and smoked a bowl right before I got in bed. The last bowl seemed to bring out some more visuals even though this was around 8 or 9 hours after I dosed. Maybe the pitch blackness and silence of my bedroom brought out some trippyness, but within 10 minutes I drifted off to sleep and woke up feeling fine. \r\nIn retrospect, I would say this was an experience I am glad I tried but don't think it is worth repeating due to the physical side effects.  If you decide to try this, just make sure you sterilize your solution by boiling and let it return to room temp. Also, do it on an empty stomach and make sure your phone is off! \r\nḰ∀ℛℭЇℵØḠИℐÖṲ\n\n\n"
