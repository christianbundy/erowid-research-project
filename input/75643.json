 "report": "<p>I went to the Endoscopy center to get a flex and a EGD done, I was very nervous as I have a fear of needles and getting an IV didn't help that any, nor did the fear of the rectal scope. But they brought me into the room and talked to me for a while explaining the procedure and the diprivan (propofol IV). They strapped the mouth piece in so they could have an open area for the scope for the EGD and they told me to relax. Things became a little blurry and what appeared to be a smokey haze over everything. I wasn't really feeling it too much and said 'I'm not feeling it', they promptly said 'Oh you will' and kinda chuckled. Suddenly overwhelming laughter came over me I just couldn't stop and I woke up in the recovery room. The power of General Anesthetics and Amnesia agents is amazing. </p><p>A little loopy for a couple minutes afterwards, and couldn't really walk. But that all went away fast. I wouldn't recommend recreational use but for those who are used to ketamine and pentothal for anethesia this newer diprivan is nothing to worry about. Actually best nap of my life.</p>"
