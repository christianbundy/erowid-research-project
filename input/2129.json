 "report": "<p>I was visiting in Boston and I happened to wander into some health food store which sold whole nutmeg nuts. I had heard about it so I figured I'd try it. When I brought it home, I completely grated three fresh nuts into a bowl, which I then mixed with milk and drank down. It tasted pretty vile at first, but I got used to it after a bit. Nothing happened for about 5 hours, but then I noticed some minor nausea and my vision was a little distorted. (Kinda like it is after a little bit o' pot.) Anyway, that continued for about 2 more hours until the nausea became really heavy. My head started spinning and I sort of forgot what was going on and why this was happening to me. It wasn't exactly enjoyable, more like having a really bad fever; being out of it is fun, but not worth it for feeling shitty all over your body. That was about the peak of the experience. After another 2 hours or so, everything subsided and I was basically completely without short term memory for the rest of the day. The next 2 or 3 days I just wanted to lie in bed and watch tv.</p><p>I would not recommend it to anyone. The work involved (grating nutmeg for some reason is kinda hard to do), drinking the stuff, feeling massively sick to your stomach, and being disgustingly lazy for the next few days is not worth the tiny buzz you get out of it. Stick to pot; it's MUCH more fun...</p>"
