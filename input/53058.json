 "report": "<p>My name's Ricky and this is a description of my first 'trip' using Mescaline.</p><p>Early in the afternoon I as able to attain one and a half feet of the cactus plant San Pedro.  After forty five minutes of the time consuming task of removing the spines and peeling off the waxy-like skin I sliced off the darker material and ground it up in a bowl mixed with a significant amount of sugar to help remove the taste.  Unfortunatley, San Pedro is just about the most vile textured and gluggy plant I've come across when eaten in this fashion.  After 45 minutes of slowly working my way through my bowl of slime I was finally done and ready for my adventure.</p><p>One and a half hours later I began to feel the effects; not obvious or overpowering like MDMA.  It was just a slight change in 'perception'.  The light in my room started to phase from bright to dark, but when I noticed it happening my mind accepted it rather then noticing it as something unnatural.  Two hours in I got in contact with one of my friends and decided to walk to his house.  The walk there, a few kilometers, seemed like a breeze.  I felt like I was floating and that my upper body was moving forward independent of any effort in my legs.  About half way I became aware of the form that my mind was starting to perceive my surroundings.  As I listened to happy hardcore music my environment felt very much like a cartoon.  Colours, sounds and shapes all started to take on a very bright and friendly aura.  </p><p>Upon reaching my friend's house we had a few conversations over the course of two hours that I felt were a little one sided.  For every word that I spoke in a sentence my mind felt compelled to spawn a new set of ideas as a reference.  Unfortunately this meant that by the time I had finished a sentence I had often forgotten what it was being said in response to.  As I spoke, my friends seemed like they were no longer conscious beings existing in a shared environment, but rather moving elements of the environment.  I felt as though my understanding and comprehension was far above that of a normal functioning being.</p><p>After a few hours I walked home, this time finding that the colours of the street lent themselves more to the chilled out music I was playing.  Often I would find that entire streets seemed to melt into a blue hue simply as a personification of the emotions brought on through the music.  However, on my journey home I began to notice a distinct alteration of my perception of time.  As something caught my interest in the street I found that my mind would work profusely towards unraveling it and finding a conclusion to it's 'meaning' I guess.  All of this would happen in the space of several seconds, leaving me with a conclusion, a process, and what seemed like hours of thinking patterns that, in reality, only occurred within the time it took me to walk five paces.</p><p>Upon returning home, I attempted to write down some of the ideas that I had focused on during my journey home.  This is where my vision started to betray me.  It seemed that as I wrote, my mental processing of the sentence I was writing worked at twice the speed of the action of putting pen to paper.  I was left watching my hand form the letters to spell the words of the sentence whilst completely forgetting where the sentence was actually headed.  Nevertheless I ended up with much legible material the next morning.  I went to bed a short while later and just let my mind roam, forming patterns and stories without meaning as I forced myself to let go of trying to understand their relevence.</p><p>Mescaline allowed my mind to work so fast that I found it impossible to translate my thoughts accurately into language.  It gave me the ability to evolve ideas at the speed of light whilst still leaving me in a mental state able to comprehend what was happening.  Very positive experience that I intend to repeat.</p>"
