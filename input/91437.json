 "report": "<p>This is my first experience with 4-FA. I ordered 500 milligrams of 4-FA from a trusted and reliable online vendor. I would glowingly recommend them to you, if I could. If only we lived in a different kind of world.</p><p>My scale has been kind of on the fritz lately, so I was not able to weigh out doses. I seperated the 500mg's into five different piles to get at least a relative idea of what amount I was taking. As such, all dosages hereafter are approximate.</p><p>I laid out what I would estimate to be about 100mg, and up my nose it went.</p><p>FIRST PRO TIP: I would not snort this stuff. I have plenty of experience snorting some of the most insidious chemicals, and this by far burnt worse than any of them. It literally makes snorting 2C-B seem like a nice massage. The burn only lasted for about 30 seconds at the most, but it's seriously not worth it. If you're the type that's inclined to snort things, you're probably going to ignore me and try it anyway (I would). I only wish I could be there to see the look on your face and say 'I told you so!'. After about 30-45 minutes had passed, I began to get an idea for how this was going to feel. The comeup was gentle, and plateaued into a pleasant mild stimulation after about an hour. At this point I decided to take a little bit more, via a different method of administration.</p><p>Which brings me to my next tip:</p><p>PRO TIP #2: I would not smoke this stuff. I laid another ~100mg onto a piece of foil to give smoking a try. It vaporizes nicely, and tastes exactly like meth. Only one problem: It doesn't work. I ended up smoking the whole amount in vain, and felt exactly the same as before I had. I don't know the reason this doesn't work, but I would guess the chemical may be destroyed by heat. Again, not sure. What am I, a chemist? Nope, just a humble drug user. </p><p>So my last option left was to eat the next dose. I think, sadly, this might just be the only realistic way for most people to take this. You may have some luck with stickin it into your booty, and I have heard that this works well. I did not try this method.</p><p>I ate about 100mg, and then an equivalent amount a couple of hours later. </p><p>Now, regarding the actual experience. This is a very mild feeling stimulant. I would agree with some folks claiming it to be reminiscent of MDMA, but only because I don't know what else I would compare it to. I would not say you're not going to feel like a rockstar, as is the case with coke and meth. You're also not going to experience that 'OH MY GOD I LOVE EVERYTHING THE WORLD IS MADE OUT OF MAGIC' feeling as with MDMA. The actual high is quite clear headed and subtle. There are body tingles and a somewhat limited euphoria towards the beginning. After the initial 'rush' (if you can call it that) wears off, I was in for about 12ish hours of gentle stimulation. I found myself feeling pretty neutral for most of the night, which is weird for this kind of drug. I was not motivated to clean, or organize, or really do anything or go anywhere. It feels actually pretty lethargic. There were also occasional flashes of feeling irritated and annoyed. I was able to think clearly and more or less rationally. Words came easy, and writing in my journal was enjoyable. I played guitar for a little while, which was definitely more fun than usual, but attempts at writing new songs were unsuccessful. Don't expect to feel exceptionally creative or spiritual. It's just not that kind of drug. My roommates were sort of in and out of the house for the duration, and I did not enjoy their company. Generally on stimulants I'll talk a mile a minute at anybody within earshot. 4-FA made me wish, for the most part, to be alone. I imagine it would be different if I had taken this with friends, and conversation probably would have been fun with people also under the influence. I tried this alone to gauge the experience before introducing it to anybody else. For science!</p><p>It seems to be pretty easy on my body. I don't feel 'fucked up', and the experience sort of slowly levels off until the end of the night. I was able to sleep with the help of a few beers. The pro-sexual aspect is pretty decent as well. If you've got a special somebody with you, you're probably going to get some serious lovin' (just be safe!). If not, prepare for an epic masturbation session.</p><p>All in all, I enjoyed the experience, and I will be trying this again. I've read reports of 4-FA mixing well with methylone, and next time I'm going to combine the two. I imagine they'd complement each other to create a much better experience than either by themselves (I find methylone to be underwhelming as well). 4-FA is not going to blow my mind, but I don't hate it either. Keep in mind my body chemistry may be different than yours, as I have read some quite glowing reviews of this chemical. If you've got about 18 hours to spare, give it a shot. You won't feel too much worse for the wear the next morning.</p>"
