 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nLet me just start off by saying that this drug combination is very overlooked in my opinion. I think it's better than candyflipping. I've had lot's of high dose experiences with acid,5meo-dmt,pcp,ketamine,amt,and mdma to name a few.<br>got my order of mimosa+harmala in the mail today along with an unfortunate note saying that my hawaiian baby woodrose seed will be another 2 weeks. Will just have to settle plain old ayahuasca then. Since I have no scale and the pieces of rootbark weren't the same size I guesstimated about 20g and boiled that along with 10-20g harmala for about 1.5hrs till I was left with no more than a shot or 2 of brown milky vile liquid. that along with a full glass of not so concentrated tea from the earlier for back up. When I go beyond a sertain point in my ayahuasca trips I usually puke it up and rocket back to bassline. I usually dont mind this too much since this stuff is so cheap but of course I would prefer to do with out the nausea.<br>T0:00 - Holy shit this stuff is nasty. I have drinken grain alcohol before but this is a different type of gross, with a bitter after taste than will make you cringe. The problem is once I start tripping I can not bring myself to drink anymore no matter what. Let's hope this works.<br>T0:30 - Just starting to feel something. I usually feel it alot sooner, hope I didnt accidently burn off the alkaloids or something.<br>T0:45 - alittle higher but still barely any visuals. Dont know why it's taken so long but I have a feeling that it will hit me pretty good.<br>T1:00 - Now I'm feeling it good. For me ayahuasca is almost like my other favorite combo E,K,Acid. It's very euphoric both mentally and physically. It's also very disorienting and disassociative like. It has almost a narcotic feel to it that is very calming and relaxing yet intense and exciting. The visuals dont have liquidyness of acid but it also doesnt have the insane head high that accompanies acid. It's great, when you come down you're completely normal except for some lingering euphoria. The whole experience is very smooth if you do it right which I'll get to in a minute.<br>T1:15 - Have to sit down. Extremely high. I feel an intense pressure not really bad but it is intense. It indeed can thrust you into the high. why the hour delay?Maybe cuz I just woke up.<br>T1:20 - Things are quite intense now. Visually it is completely different from acid. Acid is something completely of its own. That is not to say it's anything less by far.<br>T1:30 - nausea starts in the back of my mind and manifests itself into reality. Smoke a joint in hopes of eliminating it. It helps but won't stop the innevitable. But I wont go down without a fight. Gonna hold out for as long as possible. It's actually not that bad just a discomfort but i can feel it getting ready to shoot out of my mouth. Dont feel like being nauseas anymore so I gave in. It was quick and painless but I new I'd soon be back to base line and I was just getting started.<br>Now I'll try drinking slowly and see if that works better. I have a feeling it will but I have to get past the taste. Being the chef in the family I enjoy seeing to the task. So into a glass I pour 1/4th mimosayahuasca,1/4th coffee,1/2 milk then a little vanilla, about a tea spoon of cinnamon, some cocoa and lots of sugar. And heat in microwave for 1 minute. Unfortunatly I didnt have any actual mocha or cappachino mix at hand but the end product was just as good. Now I have a very delicious warm drink. I only sipped about a quarter of it when I realized that I would not need anymore. For the next 6 hours so very very high. Infact the highest I've ever been for that long.<br>The experience was everything I've ever needed. I never saw any aliens or crazy ass landscapes or anything. So maybe I could of taken more. But the sheer euphoria alone made the expereince well worth it. I was quite comfortable where I was at.<br>T6:00 just starting to come down a bit. I am still very high but I am in complete ahw of what I just expereinced. WOW! I think if I no longer had the option of taking acid or mdma I would be just fine, this stuff is gold.<br>T7:00 - Pretty much baseline. But I have a big after glow. Not shot at all. All my senses are quickly returning to normal. If I had to do a complicated school report right now I don't think I'd have any trouble. Infact I feel better than usual. Very comfortable and satisfied right now. Had a great day, especially now that I learned how to do it right'Mimochachino style'. With many more mimochachinos to come yum yum:)\n\n\n"
