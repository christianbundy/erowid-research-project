 "report": "<p>Salvia is to be taken seriously, I can't stress that enough. It is NOT a social drug. Taking salvia in a social setting will either be pointless or serve to make the trip more overwhelming.</p><p>You should have sitter, not so much for the safety of your physical body, but even more so as a comforting reminder when you return from salvia reality.</p><p>I'm an experience salvia user, but every time i've used it in the past, i've taken a few strong hits and then 'passed out' so to speak. This particular time I decided to use a more scientific approach. I took several small hits and recorded my findings as I traveled further and further into salvia reality. I used 10x salvia for this particular experience. </p><p>I should mention first that this entire experience came with a very significant uncomfortable feeling, due to my apprehension to losing touch with reality, and the overwhelming nature of salvia itself. </p><p>1st small hit: The first thing I noticed was that my heartbeat became increasingly apparent, I could hear it echoing in my head, and feel it throughout my body. I began to lose touch with my surroundings. When I closed my eyes, I got some repetitive closed eyed visuals, very colorful patterns repeating over and over endlessly. </p><p>2nd small hit: I began to feel my self being pulled downward, as if my body weighed several hundred times more than usual. When I closed my eyes I began to forget about the reality of the room. In essence I forgot that my eyes where closed and began to accept what I saw as reality. </p><p>3rd small hit: My body becomes unbearably heavy, I fall over and it feels like i'm falling in slow motion through a sea of people, I feel very much like I am part of a vast ocean of other humans. I am experiencing significant ego loss.</p><p>4th small hit: When my eyes are open I can see the objects around me transforming and contorting. When I close my eyes I am entirely enveloped in a distorted colorful reality. I feel myself being pulled through a machine that appears to move immobile human bodies from one place to another. Everything is very colorful, like a Nintendo game, Super Mario, Zelda, etc I began to feel as if this was reality and that I was part of some vast network of humans that had been trapped by machines for some unknown purpose, I find this very unsettling.</p><p>Final rather large hit: I don't remember what happened immediately after that. The next thing I remember I 'woke up' and rose up out of the human ocean I mentioned earlier. All of the people where a distinct Technicolor, red, blue, yellow. A strong commanding, yet calm voice informs me that my entire life had been a dream and that I had somehow managed to wake up, but now I have to go back sleep, and become part of the 'greater being' that I had dreamed I was, in essence he was telling me that I had to die. </p><p>At first I firmly believed that this was just an effect of the salvia, but the convincing voice notified me that the salvia was all part of the dream, and that I had to go back to sleep forever. He exerted a force on me that forced me back down into the sea of people. I could feel my soul swimming at the speed of electricity, like lighting through the sea until my mind entered into another body and I 'woke up' again. The voice became increasingly agitated at my disobedience, and once again forced me back down. </p><p>This pattern repeated for what seemed like millions of years. Eventually I was able to rise up in my room. I saw my friends sitting on the bed, but they where made up of colorful micropeople like myself. I envied them so much, I wanted to be part of the real world again, but I knew that was impossible. But I kept fighting anyways, I felt my soul continue to flow through the sea upwards further and further. I had the feeling that if I was able to reach the top I could become the greater being again. </p><p>Finally I began to slip back into reality. I began to be able to will the greater being to do what I wanted, but I wasn't out yet. I grabbed my best friend Samantha and I asked her to 'Help me,' in what she described as the most fearful voice she had ever heard. I was crying and screaming apparently. Eventually I regained my touch with reality and realized what had happened, I was drenched in sweat and I was SO happy to realize I was real, and that it was all an illusion.</p><p>I spent the next hour trying hopelessly to explain what had happened, but all I could say was that I had died for a million years.</p><p>I doubt I will try salvia again, it took me to a place I don't ever want to return to. Salvia reality is hopeless and overwhelming, had I been in a weaker mental or physical health, I don't doubt that I could have went into cardiac arrest or slipped into schizophrenia or a similar mental illness. </p><p>Salvia is a very serious drug. Just because it occurs naturally as a plant, I don't think that it isn't dangerous.  Just be careful and take great care to make sure that you are in a comfortable situation and in a serene mindset. </p><p>Good luck and happy tripping everyone.</p>"
