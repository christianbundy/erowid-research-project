The night started off really well. Several of my good friends came over to hang out at my house while the parents were out of town and brought several capsules of Molly and Foxy with them. The entire mood was great. It was just us, my house, and some great music. We dropped a Molly capsule around 12:00 am and all of my friends were rolling extremely hard within 20 minutes. I, being on a full stomach from being at work all night, didn't start to feel it until about an hour after I dropped it. At that point we had all decided that we wanted to take another Molly capsule, and the second I swallowed that thing, my first one kicked in. We were all goarded out of our minds. Everything was warm, lovey-dovey, and just perfect. <br><br>
By about 3:30 am, my boyfriend started saying that his Molly was fading away and that he wanted to take a Foxy. I was kind of hesitant at first because I don't like mixing anything with MDMA other than acid or shrooms where the capacity for harm is lessened. At that point, the rest of us figured we would do the same so we would all be on the same level. Within 20 minutes after taking the Foxy, we were all lying on the floor just totally out of it. Once the peak of the Foxy set it, everyone else realized how hard we were still rolling, and the effects of the Foxy mixed with the Molly became almost unbearable for me. Both of the drugs work off of the seratonin levels in your brain, and I felt like every last bit was being rung out of my head. It was sensory overload to the max. For the rest of the night, and late into the morning, we couldn't do much more than lie on the floor and let our eyes roll into the back of our heads. <br><br>
By about Noon, my two other friends had to leave to go to a football game, and it really scared me to let them leave my house and drive 45 minutes away when they were still that messed up in the head, but nothing was going to stop them from leaving. They made it all right, thankfully, but I don't know how they were able to manage. My boyfriend and I were still laying on the couch in sensory overload just listening to the music. <br><br>
At 5:00, I had to leave to go to work, and at that time my eyes were still dialated to the max, and I knew that I was still really messed up. It is now 9:21 in the evening and my eyes are still dialated, and I still don't feel exactly right. It's really not too great of a feeling at this point. My eyes are sore from being dialated for this long, and I've really been realizing all day that I never want to combine these two drugs together again. It's just way too much too handle. I am a natural born tweaker, so all night it really kind of annoyed me that I couldn't do anything but sit around with my eyes rolled back into my head. I also believe now that this is a dangerous combination. Not enough is really known about the possible harmful effects of combining these two, and after this past day, I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I mean, I really do not feel 'cracked' out per se, just tired and bummed out from the entire experience. All I keep thinking is, 'Damn, my brain feels like every last possible drop of seratonin has been deleted out of my brain.'<!-- End Body -->
