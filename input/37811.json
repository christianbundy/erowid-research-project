 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI just got arrested and put on six months of supervised probation for the possession of marijuana paraphinalia and some bullshit about contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Probably would be unsupervised if I didn't have the last charge. So I will be drug tested and I'm looking for legal ways to get high. Tobacco has always seemed to get me high. But I wanted to take it to a more, shall we say, spiritual level. Checking out the Natural American Spirit tobacco site, I came across their Pow-Wow Blend. Besides Nicotiania, it's got some sage, red willow, bearberry, and spearmint. These sounded good, and hey, didn't I read somewhere that sage contained a psychedlic? This could be interesting.<br>I'll have to say I was excited, my friend took me to a smoke shop and I bought a pouch of it. It's under the roll-your-own category, but it's really pipe tobacco, smoked one rolled cig and though it gave me a buzz, it was way too much. My pipe was stolen by the cops, so I needed a pipe! My friend dropped me off at another shop and I happened to glance an awesome wood pipe with native american carvings. This was the kind of pipe you need if you want to show true appreciation to the Pow-Wow Plend. <br>Pow and Wow! This stuff's good. Tastes better than any tobacco I've ever had and smells like good incense. Leaves you with a little dry mouth though, but def gets you high. I just kept smoking it. Started to get insights about myself and my relation to nature, which is all anyone can hope for. I ended up smoking another rolled cig on account of my friend wanting to test out his rolling skills. I was a little hesitant, I did anyway, and I was done, no more. Felt a little overdone, been a little sick for the past few days too, so that didn't help, but I'm convinced it was nicotine withdrawel.<br>I was trippin! I took a yohimbe several hours earlier, didn't really feel it by this point, but it could have potentiated the effects. Nonetheless, I was in a stony haze, seeing thoughts visualized. When I read more about the Pow-Wow Blend online, it made me laugh when NAS explained that the added herbs were used by the Native Americans to 'reach the spirit world'. No doubt. Different, but comparable to mj. <br>I layed down and listened to the Doors, somehow the tribal undertones of their music were a perfect accompaniment to this experience. I will say that the effects are most pronounced when laying down with eyes closed. Walking around in the light, I was more in a dreamy state of clearheadedness...but I'm just wanted to lay down and relax anyway. <br>Dreaming: Very lucid, thought I was a warlock at one point, started flying around and I seriously thought it was real. I somehow snapped myself out of sleep and was making sure I wasn't on some sort of atropine trip. I've taken benadryl before; not cool. <br>In conclusion, I'm gonna continue to do this stuff every day in every way until I get bored or find something better and just as legal. May I also point out that Native Americans kick ass.\n\n\n"
