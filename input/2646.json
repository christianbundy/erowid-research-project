 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience i would like to tell you about takes place over a year.  The first time i tried meth it was amazing. i had dabbled in weed and hash but had never even considered taking any chems until a friend of mine told me to give it a shot.  Me willing to give anything a shot once thought hell why not!  i was so happy, nothing mattered, everything seemed perfect, i thought no one could hurt me because i was so much more powerful then them.<br>My body tingled everywhere and i couldn't stop moving not even for a few seconds, it made me feel like i could do anything.  Well the next day i began to feel like shit, my friend then said if i just bummped a bit of it i would feel much better and it did.  Well this turned into line after line and didn't just become for fun it became my life, day after day was just filled with this amazing feeling that i never wanted to go away.  for months thats what i did, i would take a few days off here and there so i could sleep but never more than two days straight.  I used to be such a good kid never really did anything wrong I was the perfect girl next door type who always was there to help anyone who needed me.  Meth turned me into someone i hate, someone who had no care what other people felt, someone who didn't need anyone I would make it on my own.  Well after i had lost everything, my job, my family, and all my friends except for the one who let me try this shit in the first place but i couldn't talk to her anymore she was in rehab! <br>Well on one of the days that i had planned to be sober to sleep i actually took a look around me and finally after months realized that i didn't have anyone left.  My parents were trying to kick me out of the house, none of my old friends were even returning my phone calls and for some reason that day i couldn't sleep like i usually could i layed there wide awake counting down the hours till i could have another line.  <br>Well i couldn't wait anylonger it had been 10 hours since my last line and my body was really not liking this, thats when i got a phone call my friend had finally come out of rehab, but she had some bad news for me she wanted to talk she of all people thought I had a problem.  Look at her she just came out of rehab what does she know HA i thought.  well i ended up hanging up on her because i wanted that line that was just waiting for me! As i snoted that line up i was laughing to think she had the nerve to tell me i have a problem, just then my nose started to bleed again but this time it was worse then before i couldn't get it to stop, so i called my friend back and told her what had happened i was so scared i didn't know what to do, she came over and said she wanted to take me to the hospital. well i refused to go because i knew that i would end up where she had just come from. <br>i couldn't let that happen, finally my nose stopped after 20 mins of bleeding. i was all alone she had left because she wasn't willing to help anyone who wouldn't help themselves well thats what she said.  i sat in my room crying, i got out more meth lined it up and looked at it. i couldn't even stand the sight of the thing that had made me lose everything and everyone, but when i still was able to snort it up i think thats when i realized i had a problem!  <br>well as of today i've been sober 1 year and 2 months, and there are still days that i wish i could use but i've come so far and i know that i can't. today i now have cronic broncitis and ashma due to the extent that i storted this shit up.  by the time i quit my doctor took a chest ex-ray and couldn't belive the damage i had done by useing for only 10 months. my advice to anyone doing it or even thinking about it read this and remember this could be your life, i'm now 18 years old i have regained some trust from some old friends my parents still don't understand fully what i've gone through and i don't think they will ever forgive me for what i have done.  yes i admit this is an amazing high but is it worth losing your life for some stupid feeling?  <br>Its so adictive you'll be hooked after the first time and trust me i have seen friends die from overdosing and its not fun to watch so i can only imagine what it would be like to go through it myself. i've had to rebuild my life and i'm hoping by me writing this someone else won't have to. If you think i'm crazy and you still want to try it fine but i'm begging of you just be careful!\n\n\n"
