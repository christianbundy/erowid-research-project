Salvia Divinorum has propelled me into atmospheres that are incomprehensible.  After I experience such amazing landscapes, I realize that there is a hidden realm of the human psyche.<br><br>
One such experience shot me through hyperspace and I landed in a vast alien landscape.  While listening to Incubus, I smoked two hits of 5X and layed down on my floor.  Within seconds I felt that my body became the floor, and I felt my spirit lifting out of my body.  To the upper left of my vision I noticed a small hole that seemed to be twisting and spinning in the air.  I decided to jump into the hole, and as I did this I realized that the hole was a tunnel that looked to me like a rollercoaster ride.  I could still see everything in my room, but I felt I was riding the tunnel.  The music became a sort of background for the tunnel experience, and it calmed me down when I started to feel scared.  After what seemed like an eternity I shot out of the tunnel and floated around in a vast horizontal plane out in space. I felt the presence of two aliens that were laughing and pointing at me.  These aliens were very real, but they had a cartoon-like quality to them.  I looked to my left and saw another alien with a glowing head that was talking to me, telling me that I should not be scared.  <br><br>
I felt an extreme love towards this alien, but when I moved my vision away from it I fell back through the tunnel and took another ride until I landed back in reality.  When I was back on earth I asked myself why this happened to me.  I got mad at myself for moving my vision away from the glowing alien, because if I would have focused on it, it might have told me something important.  <br><br>
Salvia Divinorum is nothing of this world.  After this experience, I realized that it must be some sort of a communication device between aliens and humans.  Terence McKenna says the same thing about mushrooms, so I believe that Salvia is also a symbiote with a very powerful history.  The Divine Mint changed my life forevor and I hope that in the near future the government wont make it illegal.<!-- End Body -->
