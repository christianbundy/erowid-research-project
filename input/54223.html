About an hour or so ago - popped 150mg of tramadol (Ultram) hcl (three<br>
pills so far). <br><br>
12:38pm (now) - popped one more to make it 200mg after reading up on the pills online a little bit. feeling mildly sedated but still up at <br>
the same time. i like this high a lot. i'm waiting for my <br>
friend to deliver my weed to me. i can't wait for the full 200mg<br>
to kick in so i can see what this stuff is all about.<br>
listening to The Futureheads and it sounds alright. i may be<br>
changing the music soon.<br><br>
12:42pm - decide to change the music to Gnarls Barkley. definitely feeling the <br>
pills but i'm not used to them so i don't know what to be expecting<br>
or anything. i'm going to continue reading about the pills. the <br>
body high kind of feels like ecstasy. somewhat euphoric. mild <br>
jitters etc.<br><br>
12:48 - my weed is here!! i'm going to roll up a skimp cigarillo and see if the<br>
weed heightens the high at all. i find myself making a lot of typing<br>
mistakes. finishing up a cigarette. thinking alot about Gnarls Barkley<br>
and how genious the group is. breaking up weed as i write this.<br><br>
1am - blunt lit. hands were very clumsy and shaky while rolling it. it's very<br>
small but it will do the job. sweating mildly. very jittery. almost<br>
uncomfortable but the weed is chilling me out as i type this.<br><br>
1:05 - blunt is becoming a roach. feeling very good. very very good. sedated.<br>
dreamy. very good. realizing tramadol and weed is a very very very very<br>
good combo. i may roll up another cigarillo in a little while if i'm<br>
feeling up to it. dazed. i fall into very deep dazes in with the music<br>
every once in a while. thinking about putting on some ambient/electronic<br>
music. hot hot heat is playing at the moment. feeling very lazy.<br><br>
1:08 - Mouse on Mars - Idiology album begins. i put on a pair of stereo headphones at 1:10. feeling wild. music is very loud in the headphones.<br><br>
1:14 - turn itunes visualizer on. the visualizer puts me in a daze.<br><br>
1:17 - slightly numb in my mouth for some reason. i decide to put on a crazy<br>
song by rjd2. no more visualizer for now. very fucked up. smoking a<br>
cigarette. this report is going to be very interesting to read. i've<br>
been reading many reports similar to what is unfolding here. this drug<br>
... tramadol.... i like this drug. although i got these pills for free..<br>
i would, without a doubt, pay for more. they're very good. i just seem<br>
to keep getting more and more fucked up. I LOVE IT..<br><br>
1:21 - reading over my report so far. i like it. this is just getting started..<br>
i can tell. RJD2 - 1976 is BANGIN' in my headphones. Ghostwriter by<br>
the same band begins... sounds very good. music is becoming a journey..<br>
each song is a different journey. all the music i'm playing right now<br>
is instrumental/electronic. so no lyrics. i'm thinking about putting<br>
on some good rock. feeling very good. i go get a cup of water and<br>
turn the light off in my room at 1:25.<br><br>
1:26 - Such Great Heights - The Postal Service begins... this music is so<br>
amazing. the heart put into the songs. the postal service is genious.<br>
the pills are great. but i'm just gonna let it flow from here on. the<br>
music causes tons of emotion.. it's all wonderful. i lovvvve this. closing<br>
eyes liping the lyrics. when i close my eyes the music flows through me.<br>
minor CEV's. my body is moving in all sorts of ways to the music. sort<br>
of dancing while sitting down. i don't dance. good feelings are all over<br>
the place at 1:29. <br><br>
1:30 - brand new colony - the postal service begins... i IM a friend. mild<br>
nausia begins. the music is great. i like the faster pace of this track.<br>
there's no way i would want to drive on this drug
note.  <font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font> drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated.<br><br>
1:36 - explosions in the sky starts. i just changed into my night time clothes.<br>
feeling good but tired. debating whether to smoke more weed. myspace<br>
is a very very useful tool. one of the best thing's i've seen in the<br>
2000's. the music is wonderful as usual.<br><br>
1:43 - music is great. talking to two friends. feeling good. getting<br>
into deep conversation about drugs with one of my friends. almost<br>
coming down. i wanna smoke more weed. i don't feel like rolling a blunt.<br>
feeling dazed and tired but happy. the music is fueling me at the moment.<br><br>
1:53 - i turn the light on to roll up a cigarillo but i'm trying a different<br>
method of rolling. (using joint roller). hoping it'll work.<br><br>
2:01 - mini blunt lit. burning nice and slow. it's like a fat joint-sized<br>
cigar. rolled with perfection. it hits like a dream.i'm gonna be <br>
ripped.<br><br>
2:07 - the blunt is almost done. i can't believe i just texted the girl of my<br>
dreams.<br><br>
2:10 - blunt is done. i'm having a flirtatious text message conversation with the<br>
girl of my dreams. WHAT?! i'm for real. explosions in the sky is one<br>
of the best of all time. simple as that. i just felt a very euphoric<br>
feeling. it was very random. but it was welcomed once it came on. this<br>
drug is WILD.<br><br>
2:14 - i spark up a cigarette. the album 'The Rescue' - Explosions in The Sky is<br>
one of the most emotional albums i have ever heard. this band has so<br>
much heart. i love finding REAL MUSIC. Day Three - explosions.... this<br>
track is unbelievable. i'm happy. almost ready for sleep. the cigarette<br>
is very good. camel lights are very rich.<br><br>
2:18 - appreciatin' my cigs. lol. this drug is minorly similar to ecstasy which<br>
is unbelieveable. the marijuana jets this drug out of control... but i<br>
love it. this music is CRAZY. <br><br>
2:21 - i've calmed down a lot since the beginning of this trip report. i like<br>
it a lot more now than i did then. my mind wonders easily now. but<br>
i can bring it back very fast. the music is still fueling me. this<br>
would be nothing without the music. the soundtrack to this night is<br>
classic because it made my night for me.<br><br>
2:24 - i decide it's getting late and that it's almost time for sleep. it will<br>
come easily in the state i'm in at the moment. i'm on track five of an <br>
8 track album. i think i'll finish it and go to sleep. i couldn't<br>
NOT finish this album. it's too good to be ended so quickly. i'm surprised<br>
music is this appreciated on this drug. i'm wondering if i'm one of <br>
few that have used this drug for it's opaiate ability and not just for<br>
back pain or if a lot of people use it for this. i love this drug.<br>
i'll defiitely come out of this trip with more kowledge...<br>
which is very good. i may or may not do these again. i have enough for <br>
two more trips equal dosage to the one i'm on now (200mg, four pills).<br>
as a side note i will mention that i broke the pills in half before<br>
i took them so the effects would come on quicker. just incase i forget<br>
that small bit.<br><br>
2:30 - smoking a cigarette. this girl is so cute. i wish she was here next to <br>
me right now. on track 6 going on track 7 now. i tidy up my room a bit<br>
before laying down to go to sleep. flipped the light off in the begining<br>
of the seventh track. my legs feel kind of numb. i like it. laying down<br>
is gonna feel so good. mildly sweating. thinking about that girl that i<br>
can carry on a conversation so well with.<br><br>
2:36 - begining of the last track of the album. this is about it for the night!<br>
i'm just gonna chill to this song. close my eyes and melt. the track is<br>
mildly upbeat. this it for the night. i'll update in the morning.<br><br>
2:38 - i turn off the computer and lay down for sleep. the trip has been long <br>
and good.<br><br><br>
[next day]<br>
12:07pm - i feel very worn down today. very lazy. these pills definitely come<br>
with a hang over. nothing too bad. but i can tell it's there. my<br>
morning has been bad because there's a kid that has been blowing up<br>
my phone since 8am and he has not stopped calling. i guess he needs a<br>
ride somewhere. but yeah, after a shower i'm hoping i won't feel so<br>
worn down and tired today. i'm going to read over my report from last<br>
night. <br><br>
12:19 - falling asleep last night, from what i can remember, was very easy. i<br>
remember my body was twitching a lot. way way more than usual. the<br>
twitching was definitely caused by the pills. i kinda remember having<br>
minor CEVs before falling asleep which were kind of keeping me from<br>
completely relaxing. i'm really tired still. bout to get in the shower.<br><br>
12:25 - i hop in the shower.<br><br>
12:43 - exiting shower. realizing that i came out of this trip with a lot more <br>
than i originally thought i came out of it with. i'm having the urge<br>
to try something new! i want to impress someone or go to the beach or<br>
something i don't normally do! i want to adventure somewhere that i've<br>
never been. i have a feeling this trip has pushed me to try new things.<br>
i don't know why or how exactly... but i like it. still feeling mild<br>
effects. feeling refreshed after my shower. i feel motivated but tired.<br>
it's all good. i may or may not expiriment with these pills again soon.<br><br>
[EDIT!]<br>
1:08pm - slight nausea led to projectile vomiting everything out of my stomach (just water). it was horrible but i feel better now. i hadnt eaten last night or this morning, so maybe now i'll eat something. i was not expecting that.<br><br>
2:30 - first bit of food in 15 hours. slice of pizza. not much of an appetite but i know i need to eat. I'm basically forcing it down.<!-- End Body -->
