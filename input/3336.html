I've been playing with morning glory seeds for a while now, and it's hard to summarize the experience. It's been a mix of good and bad, but almost always interesting. I don't know if I'll do it again, though, considering the trouble it takes to prepare the seeds and how easy it is to get more reliable substances.<br><br>
1st attempt: 7.2 g extract, little effect<br>
On my first attempt, I used 7.2 g of seeds (about 265), all Better Homes and Gardens Heavenly Blues. I washed the seeds with detergent and ground them coarsely with a pestle and mortal, which was a lot of trouble and didn't work well. I soaked the grounds in Zippo fluid for 1 hour, dried them then soaked them in Everclear (190 proof) for 5 days and drank the resulting alcohol (but skipped the solids). I quickly lost my appetite and felt intoxicated, probably from the alcohol. After about an hour I felt some slight nausea. I watched _The Wall_, and had to stop at one point to avoid crying. Pink Floyd affects me a lot normally, but this seemed like too much. After the movie I went to a rave which was a total disappointment I couldn't tell I had any effects from the seeds, and the rave was a bomb, too. I took 200 mg of caffeine, but this only made me jittery, probably because I hadn't eaten. At T + 9 hours I got home and noticed some mild LSD-like visual distortions but had no trouble going to sleep.<br><br>
2nd attmpt: 9 g extract, mild but good effect<br>
This time I used a mix of Heavenly Blues, Flying Saucers and Pearly gates totalling 15 g, 510 seeds. The brand was Burpee. I prepared basically as before, soaking for 20 min in Zippo fluid and 4 days in 150 mL of Everclear. Also I used a coffee grinder and got a much finer power with much less effort. I split the magic potion with a friend. This felt similar to 1 hit of acid for me--pleasant, but not entertaining in itself. There was noticeable pupil dilation. I went to a rave and felt very sociable, and the music was very intense and entertaining. There were few visuals, but my depth perception we screwed up. I had some muscle tension and very slight nausea, similar to MDMA. At 7 hours I was still experiencing mild visuals and music was beautiful, but I was too tired to really enjoy it so I went to sleep. Overall the experience was pleasant and euphoric but not really trippy. It probably helped that the rave was an especially good one, with a great vibe and big-name musicians. For me, this method is probably a good substitute for X at a rave. The high isn't as good, but I felt happy and mellow the next day, not hung over at all.<br><br>
3rd attempt: 9 g extract, good effect<br>
Very similar to before. 9 g of BH&amp;G Heavenly Blues, coffee grinder, 20 min in Zippo fluid, several days in 100 mL of Everclear. I didn't strain this well enough, so the extract had some very unpleasant chunks in it. Also don't mix Everclear and Kool-Aid. It's nasty. Drinking this goo made me a little sick, but it passed quickly. This worked about as well as before, plus I added a little X after a couple of hours. I had a *very* good time except for a little emotional bumpiness coming down from the X. After nine hours total (around 7 am) I felt very alert (strange after staying up all night!) but otherwise completely normal. I had to drive 10 hours after that, and had a huge amount of caffeine to stay awake. By the last hour I began experiencing auditory hallucinations of sirens all around me after hearing a few real sirens at some point (I think!) Of course this was probably just sleep deprivation, but everything also had a strong but intangible trippy quality reminiscent of acid and not like sleep deprivation at all. It was quite pleasant and didn't impair my driving at all. Once I got home I had a smoke and went to sleep.<br><br>
4th attempt: 9 g (?) raw seeds, got really sick<br>
I was beginning to suspect the extract wasn't working as well as it should by this point, so I just ground up and ate some seeds. I tried mixing them with grapefruit juice and crushed up vitamin C tablets to cover the taste, but drinking the grainy liquid was still difficult and nearly made me puke. I had a couple of small puffs of weed, which eliminated the nausea but didn't get me high. After a few minutes I began to feel the effects, and sat down to listen to my new Shpongle CD. Between the drugs and the music, this was AMAZING! By about the 1.5 hour mark I was feeling the intense urgent feeling I associate with coming up on acid. I had a friend drive me to a club. Big mistake! While there I developed a headache and felt generally sick, but didn't really notice this much at the time. I was too incoherent to talk to sober people, but I was a hit with a group that was rolling pretty hard. After a few hours I began to see a strong rippling effect--looking at the city skyline, there appeared to be intense heat waves like in a desert. By this point I was feeling quite ill and the weather was way too cold. I sat next to a speaker for a moment wanting to be alone, and when I closed by eyes I could see the club with the people gone. I eventually decided that it would be irresponsible of me to just sit around and let my ears get blasted out by bland house music, so I decided to go home. I went out through a very warm room in the club and then out into the cold. The temperature change was too much for me, and I knew I was going to puke. I searched for a place to do it discretely, but I couldn't control it and puked violently right on the street. There were cops around and I was very embarrassed. By this time it was around 3 am. I wandered around the empty streets freezing and looking for any open store so I could find a bathroom to wash off. Eventually I found a taxi to take me home, though. The driver thought I was very drunk. I got home and showered, all the while feeling stupid for having poisoned myself, but glad to be home. The effects were still going strong when I went to sleep. The next day I felt mild effects, steadily decreasing until late that night when they disappeared completely. It was a pleasant day. I watched documentaries about insects, which were completely fascinating. I danced to the Shpongle CD and felt like some kind of shaman. I think that day made the preceeding night worth it somehow. It wasn't intense, but it was very mellow and enjoyable.<br><br>
I've had one more experience where I got to know the effects of morning glory seeds in great detail; I've described it in a separate report.<!-- End Body -->
