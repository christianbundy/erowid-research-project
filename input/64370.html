Preparations:<br><br>
I am a 17 year old male, who has taken 2CB once before.  Last trip I was alone and new to this substance, so I was very frightened.  This time, however, I gathered my thoughts on what I'd be doing all night and what to do if trouble occurred.  To start off, I got all the things necessary for my trip pre-gathered.  I grabbed all black clothes with black tennis shoes.  (This was so I could go for a walk in the night without being noticed.)  I also got my iPod fully charged with a very good play list set up so I'd have something to listen to while out.  Before I went for my walk I pre-decided where I'd go and where I'd run if danger occurred (cops).  I also bought a 1 liter bottle of water from a gas station (to stay hydrated).  I also brought a black hoodie and wrapped it around my waist to wear if I got cold.  Oh I also brought a FULL pack of gum because I experience a jaw chattering effect whilst on 2CB.  After I got back from my walk, I planned to meditate (I heard it is very enlightening).<br><br>
Weather Climate:<br>
Michigan/Summer/80.1 F<br><br>
Note:  While on 2CB it is very normal to feel cold.  I put on a sweatshirt but you must remember that you may only think your cold even though you could be very warm.  So be careful!<br><br>
Experience:<br><br>
Ok, now this is going to be a little difficult because Im recounting what Ive done whilst still on.  So I started off my trip with a walk.  I went out my basement door trying to be as quiet as possible.  I went out towards a park near my house to keep shelter from prying eyes.  Well as I was walking through the park, I noticed A LOT of fire flies.  I was amazed by their beauty, just floating around.  I just wanted to stare for hours, but no, I was off on a journey to walk to nowhere.  So I pressed on.  Well I always found myself paranoid at ANY light, thinking that it might be a cop or neighbor seeing ME, knowing what IM on.  It could be a street lamp or just a light within a house that would startle me.  Scared shitless I pressed on.  To make a side note, I would always see flickers of light in every direction.  I was never sure of what they were or if they even existed.  I also saw a lot of objects morph into other things. (Ex: Rock into a wolf, mailbox into a person, etc.)  <br><br>
Well you really dont have anything to worry about until the cops show. Right?  Well as I was walking down a street in my neighborhood I caught the attention of some headlight.  Fuck I thought.  Shit, what should I do?  So I decided to play it off as normal, I mean it was only like 12:30AM.  The guy may just think Im walking home.  Well it got closer until it was almost at a crawl next to me.  Now Im still trying to act as normal (FUBAR) as possible and this car is just gnawing at me.  Im just about to run, when, it pulls into the driveway 2 feet behind me.  Oh come on.  That was a HOLY SHIT moment and it really messed with my mind.  Well I look back at the car and just walk away.  I mean hopefully theyll just leave me alone and let me finish my walk to nowhere.  Well an hour and four miles later I ended up home with this little story.  Along with a bunch more stories about how I think I might be being followed by people who know what Im on and doing.  (I know, hard to follow.)  In the back of my mind it felt like imaginary people devised a little conspiracy to tell my parents all the naughty stuff Ive been doing.  (ALL THIS SHIT GOES THROUGH MY HEAD.)<br><br>
Well now Im home.  Its 2:07AM and I still have a lot of trip left in me. <br><br>
So now I find myself lying back listening to music because there is nothing left to do.  Now Im just really bored.<br><br>
-Remember kids.  Boredom is the first step back to relapse- Clerk II<br><br>
With the dizzy movement of images (unable to tell what is there) while my eyes are closed, I find it hard to do just about anything.  While on 2CB I notice how I'm more in touch with all my body.  Not in a weird way, but more of an I know whats going on' kind of way.  Well I start gaining a better understanding of my body and what it likes and dislikes.  I start looking at my body as being its own entity.  In a sober state of mind Id say my conscience is trying to make me feel guilty for abusing my body with such a chemical.  But I have never taken such a strong stand as this.  <br><br>
After getting bored trying to discover myself, I decided to go online and watch some cartoons.  The time was about 3:20AM and I assume I was either coming down or just finishing up my trip.  Well now I was really bored.  So I watched Animaniacs and Freakizoid until I was able to fall asleep at about 5:00AM.  I know it sounds funny to watch cartoons but I found it best to revert to cartoons that you loved in order to ease the comedown.  Reversion to your childhood can usually bring back positive thoughts and memories.  This I found made it easier to go to sleep.  The next morning, I suffered no hangover affects other than being tired.  (I had a lack of sleep because I had work at 1PM the next morning.)  <br><br>
Altogether I found my trip a lot of fun and a great way to see new things from a different perspective.<!-- End Body -->
