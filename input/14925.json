 "report": "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing the world needs is another glowing AMT report from the likes of me, so I will abbreviate the early portion of this report.  A friend from out of town was visiting, and we spent a lazy afternoon on AMT together (I took approximately 88mg or so).  We both remarked upon the consistency of AMT, how reliably it produces such a pleasurable state for us.  Toward the end of the evening, we began watching some movies that I wrote and directed when I was in high school and college.  I rarely show these movies to anyone, but my friend and I interact often on an artistic basis; she claimed that seeing these early works gave her insight into my development as an artist, and seeing these movies again after years of letting them collect dust managed to give me insight as well.\r\nWe split a bag of mushrooms as the fourth movie started, a movie called The Chaos Affair that I produced in college.  We were both quite surprised by the quality of the piece; it was significantly sharper than I remembered and a lot more fun to watch.  It is at this point that I must point out: I have no idea how many mushrooms I actually ate.  I couldnt even begin to estimate, beyond 'a lot'.  I answer to no one but myself in these matters, and the universe will punish me as it sees fit.  Perhaps ten minutes went by and then suddenly I felt my first alert.  It was not an ordinary mushroom alert for me; it felt considerably more as though I was getting a first 5-MeO-DMT alert.  My senses perked up immediately.\r\nI should point out that I have had several experiences with extremely large doses of mushrooms, considerably larger than the dose I had just eaten.  In particular, I participated in a pair of sweat lodge ceremonies involving huge bags of mushrooms, where I ate mushrooms until I couldnt physically lift my hand to my face anymore because I was tripping so hard.  I hallucinated an entire tribe of Native Americans charging through our bonfire; I hallucinated my own body turning into a wolf; I hallucinated myself as an infant emerging from a womb, only instead of emerging into the warm and comforting arms of a mother, I was surrounded by hideous aliens intent on my destruction.  \r\nThis was different.  The mushroom alerts held little in common with what I typically expect from mushrooms, and the unfolding trip felt almost exactly like 5-MeO-DMT, except a milder, less frenetic version.  I began to get giddy, and a warmth flowed through me as I watched myself on screen from ten years ago.  My laughter got heartier.  Eventually we paused the movie for a bathroom break, and as I got up, the air was thick with sensation.  With 5-MeO, I am often compelled to move; with this experience, I was choosing to move.  It was gentler than 5-MeO but still quite blissful, and had the benefit of not wearing off after 30 minutes.  A rush of creative ideas flowed through me as I realized I had forgotten some very good characters and good lines from my old work.\r\nAfter the movie finished, my friend wanted something more like eye candy, so we put on a DVD that neither of us had seen before, a gift I recently received called Star Gaze: Hubbles View Of The Universe.  This DVD is, quite literally, one of the most astounding pieces of media Ive ever encountered.  It presents over an hour of images of the universe as taken by the Hubble Telescope.  I do not exaggerate when I say that these are images of nearly maddening beauty.  We were stunned into an amazed silence as we watched the mysteries of the universe unfold before us.  Wed managed to select the option that disabled the voiceover, so we had no idea what these astonishing sights actually were, but I think that was probably for the best, considering our state.  The universe, as it turns out, is massively colorful, brilliant and iridescent, gorgeous beyond belief.  For an hour, we were tiny specks on a tiny ball amidst a vast sea of immense wonder and complexity; I cant imagine a more clearer vision of perspective than these sights.  I wished dearly to believe that someone had planned all of this majesty, but I could feel inside me that it isnt true.\r\nEventually, after perhaps three and a half hours or so, my friend headed off to bed; she hadnt tripped nearly as hard as I had.  I was coming down, certainly, but hardly there yet.  I swallowed a xanax and climbed into bed, where my partner was sleeping, finding myself enveloped in a warm cocoon.  It was like floating in an amniotic bath.  Normally I detest disco napping, but this was different, more entertaining and more unique.  I listened to the wild sounds inside my head and watched the unfolding geometric patterns behind my eyelids until the alarm went off, at which point I swallowed another xanax and finally fell asleep.\r\nThis is the first time mushrooms have produced this kind of sensation in me, but I have a relatively small amount of mushroom experience compared to my experience with other substances.  I am familiar with the way that low doses of mushrooms often feel lightly empathogenic, so it seems to make sense that larger doses can feel even more so; but just as often it seems that large doses of mushrooms can take on a dark aspect.  Thats probably where the AMT came in, harnessing the mushroom energy and infusing it with its own 'preposterously good mood'.  I can see a range of experimentation for the future: getting more familiar with various high doses of mushrooms, changing the timing of adding mushrooms to AMT, etc.  All this will occur when I someday retire to my drug experimentation laboratory located conveniently on the bottom of the ocean, outside the reach of the long arm of the law.\n\n\n"
