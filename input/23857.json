 "report": "<p>This was my first time ever trying mushrooms, an experience I am very grateful for. I was at a snowboard camp in BC and it was Canada Day! Me and my friend had met a guy (I will call him R), who asked us if we wanted to try mushrooms. I said yes, but my friend backed out at the last minute. At first I was a bit paranoid as I didn't know anyone who had tried them before and I had only met this guy earlier that day. I didn't think the effects would be as amazing and as intense as they turned out to be. Little did I know the great journey I was about to begin.</p><p>Around 8:00pm, me and R began to consume the mushrooms, although he gave me almost all of them and only took a little for himself, even though he was an experienced shroomer. This added to my paranoia, because I had no idea what this drug would do to me. Nothing seemed to be happening about 10 minutes later so we decided to go for a hot tub in the hotel pool. A little boy joined us along with some other girl. The little boy kept talking and talking to us, and I began to think his raspy little voice was quite funny. I looked at the clouds and they were pink, purple, and blue and made out of lego-like squares. I told R to look at the clouds because they were so amazing, and he said yeah they are cool hey, although when I think back to it, I know he didn't see anything. And then an airplane flew threw the lego clouds, and everything split apart. To me this was amazing and I did not know that I was beginning to trip out because I expected the shrooms to do nothing. R and I decided it was time to go back to the hotel room.</p><p>As we walked through the hotel lobby, it seemed as though every camper and coach and counsillor from my snowboard camp was their cheering me on, although I am not sure if any of them were actually there or not. On the elevator ride up I was in a feeling of complete thanks towards R and could not thank him enough. He went to his room to shower and I went back to mine to get dressed. Back at my room, my friend who had decided not to trip was really bugging me because she kept asking me to go shopping with her or do something because she was borred. She was really aggravaiting me and it just got worse when some other non-trippers showed up. I tried to get away from them and laid down on my bed, where I proceeded to stare at the stucco ceiling, the pictures formed from the white dots were amazing and seemed to cascade down all over my body. I wished so much that the other non-tripers could see what I could see. </p><p>The seconds seemed like minutes and I kept asking my friend if it had been ten minutes yet, when I was supposed to meet in R's room again. She said I asked her about every ten seconds. Now it was around 10:00. That was the longest ten minutes of my life and I was getting very immpatient. Finally it was time to go back to R's room. </p><p>When I got there, about 3 more people had showed up and R had gone to bed because he had given most of the mushrooms to me and didn't keep enough for himself. I walked into their room and although the three new guys were complete strangers to me, I felt as if I knew them my whole life. I went and layed right down on one of their laps, and I am sure he thought that was pretty sweet and that he was going to get some action that night (he never did though). This one boy seemed so soothing and calming as he talked to me, even though I was in a state of complete happiness and didn't say one word, only nodded occasionally, even when he asked me my name. His face was soft and flowing, and so happy.</p><p>The TV was on and each commercial seemed like an hour long show. Pamela Anderson came on the TV for some commercial and I began saying how people shouldn't be so judgemental and that she is a good person, I really felt for her. That was one of the few things I said when I was laying there. I remember thinking that everyone on TV was on shrooms, and that the whole world should do them because everyone would be so happy and free-spirited. I thought so many great things about life and how beautiful people are, and that we should all be more accepting. I had so much to say but I just didn't feel like talking, I felt that all of the guys in the room knew exactly what I was thinking about. I continued to stare into the face of the guy I was laying on, and he just smiled with understanding. I had the biggest grin on my face for the longest time. The guy tried to go up my shirt, and I just let it happen (which isn't totally like me), but I thought in my mind that there was no harm in it, it's just a nice guy touching me softly. It felt so good though, the touch was intensified by the drug and I could feel his touch tingling throughout my whole body. I really felt a connection with him. </p><p>I kept on thinking that I had pissed my pants, because I had just slipped on my PJ's over top of my wet bathing suit. I didn't even care about how I looked, in my mindset, appearance was just another thing that the world should forget about. Then we heard the Canada Day fire works outside. The immages were the most intruiging, beautiful things I had ever seen. They seemed to reach out to me, and I just can't explain how cool it looked. I could only watch for a few seconds, the noise was too intense.</p><p>Then came the part of my trip where I thought that shit was about to hit the fan. A coach from the camp came in to make sure that all the guys were where they were supposed to be, and I wasn't supposed to be there. It was a little bit after 11:00 and roomcheck was at 10:00. I thought I would be in deep shit. The coach asked the guys what my name was, and they didn't know, because I never told them. Then he asked me what my name was, and I just nodded and didn't say anything, until realized it was a coach, so I said my name and headed back to my room. The short hallway seemed so long, and the blue, black, red and yellow paterns in the carpet were so pretty. I saw a reflection of myself in the window, and I was floating along and wearing a beautiful glowing robe, like an angel. I didn't want to quit watching myself.</p><p>When I got back to my room, no one was there. I went to my bed and began crying and crying and trying to think of an excuse to tell my parents. I felt so alone and was mad at my room mates for not being there when I got back. I tried to calm myself by looking at the stucco ceiling again. That worked for a while. When my room mates came back, I started crying again because I thought the coach would tell my parents for sure. They told me to wait until I was back to normal again before I freak out. My friend made me some macaroni and cheese and I felt safe again. It felt wierd going to the bathroom and I was sort of scared to do it. It was now around 1:00AM and I was starting to go down. I could tell I still wasn't completely normal and decided it would be better for me to not talk and just relax in my bed, so I fell asleep. </p><p>The next morning I felt great and headed out to the mountain. Then I remembered the shit I was going to be in. Little did I know, the coach who had caught me was also on mushrooms too! We had our little joke about it for the rest of the week. THAT was a relief. </p><p>The experience changed me in a positive way. It helped me to not focus on the un-important details in life, and to be more open and accepting with people. That happy-life buzz didn't last forever thoough, but everytime I do mushrooms that buzz comes back to me for a few months. It taught me a great appreciation for life, and overall, made me a happier person. </p><p>The worst part is that I don't know who those guys I spent that night with were, and I want to thank R for introducing me to mushrooms, something that had a great impact on my life. I am also regretful that I don't know who the guy was that let me lay on his lap all night, I still feel a connection with that guy I knew only a few hours. All of the guys left early the next morning, and I never even got to say goodbye.</p>"
