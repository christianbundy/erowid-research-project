I'm 21 years old, use no supplements or medications, have followed a consistent regimen of meditation for a year and a half, and smoked copious amounts of cannabis from ages 16-19: often in excess of 2 ounces a week between myself and a few friends. Since then I had smoked only on occasion for some time, but until this past Saturday night I hadn't smoked for the better part of a year. I got a gram of some sweet-smelling (and tasting as I would later find out [as a side note, it probably takes some time to acquire a taste for the aroma and flavor of cannabis, but my taste seemed as developed as ever: the mere smell of the sticky bud made my mouth begin to water]) bud from an old friend along with a fair warning concerning its potency. I knew going in that after nearly a year of not smoking I would have effectively zero tolerance, so I anticipated smoking from this single gram once a week over a month-long period.<br><br>
I decided to hold on to the pot and not use it until Saturday night, using Friday night for some meditation in preparation for my coming journey. I had luckily held on to the only pipe I had ever owned (an index finger-sized glass chillum I bought when I was 16), so I didn't need to go and buy another.<br><br>
After a long week of work, I spent Friday night in trance-like meditation followed by a couple good records. I sat upright on my couch, making myself aware of cognizance and re-familiarizing myself with its qualities. I perceived every sound as an emanation from my Self, each one a vibration of the sempiternal and dual-faced energy of existence just as my breath pours in and out of my lungs. Oftentimes when I follow up meditation with music, I find myself slipping back into the state of meditation and will abruptly return to everyday awareness to find the record ended long ago; but not on this occasion.<br><br>
On Saturday night I followed much the same method, but I introduced a bit of cannabis (1/5th of a gram) into the proceedings. I began to meditate, and remained in the trance for some 20 minutes or so. Feeling relaxed but also excited, I pulled out my pipe and weed and decided what music to kick off the experience with. I put the music on (Burzum - Det Som Engang Var), loaded the bowl, and commenced the smoking.<br><br>
The smoke rolled smoothly down my throat as I enjoyed its piney, vegetal flavor. I took three hits, holding each for some 10 or 15 seconds. I left what remained in the bowl for later.<br><br>
As I sat back, the effects were almost immediate: I felt an airy sensation in the frontal lobe, a heightened awareness of pressures and congested energies in the limbs and joints, and lights appeared to transmit through an aqueous membrane. I closed my eyes, and found that the normally fleeting and inconsistent hues of color had organized themselves into coherent yet ever-changing forms. I discovered blossoming lotuses of untold depths and beauty; majestic fractals of baffling dimensions and illimitable complexity. <br><br>
My ears heard the continuing music, my eyes (third eye?) peered into the dancing holograms, my nerves became excited by unending feeling, my mind perceived an infinity of thoughts: and yet, among all these dynamic sensations I found that I could select one upon which to direct my entire faculty of awareness and sense. I recognized that each musical chord or note, each step of the visionary dance, each single feeling, and each thought can be suspended and examined to infinite depth and resolution: I had only to put forth the effort.<br><br>
Making myself aware of the music, I entered a world of stupefying majesty. Though broadcast in stereo, the waves of musical energy enveloped my entire being. The music took on a quality of nostalgia: not unlike how you would remember an old fairy-tale you often heard in childhood, but much more ancient. The vibrations were powerful, and it seemed to me that they found their origin in my self. I sensed that I had been there before, long ago.<br><br>
Shifting my awareness to the closed-eye visions, I became rapt in awe. I found that among the myriad dancing forms I could select a single aspect of one single form, making it my whole awareness. As I gazed therein, it seemed as though a seed planted there who knows how many eons ago had abruptly sprouted into a magnificent tree or bush. As I watched the process, each leaf multiplied in exponential fashion until that single seed had grown to unfathomable proportions; stretching before, behind, above, and below my point of vantage and beyond the horizon of my mind's eye. Each leaf continued the blossoming dance which bore it, and as I shifted my awareness to a wider perspective that single aspect which engaged my whole consciousness became suddenly lost in an ocean of mercurial color and ever-changing patterns: yet I noticed that even this macroscopic form was caught in the same dance which I observed absorbing its constituents. To me, this came as no surprise.<br><br>
I opened my eyes and realized that the record had ended. Looking at the clock I saw that about an hour has passed, and I drank a tall glass of room temperature water to allay the extreme drymouth which I hadn't noticed with my eyes closed. I put on a Beethoven Symphony No. 2 record, and in about 2 hits finished off the remainder of the bowl. I held in the smoke as before and slowly allowed it to escape from my throat. As I watched the pale smoke move through the air I realized that it was dancing the same dance as the closed-eye visuals I was engaged with, only at a somewhat slower and less fervent pace. For some reason or another, this made me laugh.<br><br>
Feeling extremely giddy and connected with the world, I again closed my eyes, returned to my meditation, and this time directed my full awareness to feeling. In doing so, I was made painfully aware of the energetic congestion in my joints and limbs. By directing my awareness from point to point, I found I could consciously ease the coagulating stress and restore balance to the affected area. I felt the effects of the soothing and naturalistic music as it vibrated the air around my skin and then vibrated my skin directly: it felt somewhat like an itch, but an itch which is continually scratching itself. At particularly powerful points in the music a tremor of energy would surge from my crown throughout my entire body, causing shivers of delight and satisfaction to traverse from head to toe.<br><br>
Deciding now to delve into my consciousness, I came to rest my awareness upon the mind; again and again becoming intrigued by my thoughts. Many times I found myself ruminating on my earlier years or coming to a sudden realization about a dream I had long ago. I found that all these thoughts had a hidden correlation which I need only consider for a moment to uncover. This also made me laugh gaily as I was again reminded of the universal connectivity most people do not even remotely understand: not even those who believe themselves to. Very often an intense sense of deja vu would leave me wondering whether I was dreaming or if I had dreamt this situation before. The clarity I achieved in this defocalized (i.e. non-rational) state is remarkable, and my petty human concerns seemed unimportant and negligible: so easily solved are they.<br><br>
I opened my eyes, and again realized the music had already ended. A glance at the clock revealed that at least another hour had gone by. I was amazed at how easily I could leave the outside world beyond my self and become lost in my own personal being: so much so that I would not even realize that music had gone from playing to not playing. The fact that I did not notice that the music had stopped playing does not mean that I was unable to hear and experience the music as it was playing. Indeed, it seemed that if anything I hadn't noticed the record ending simply because my mind had continued the theme of the music on its own, and that what I perceived inside of my self was an extension of the music. This was a powerful realization, and I considered my self akin to the blossoming plants I had seen; I saw my consciousness as both parent and child to the music, as both I and the music mutually influenced our respective dances. I smiled, and decided it was a fine time to go to bed.<!-- End Body -->
