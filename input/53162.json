 "report": "<p>I had come across a bit of acid in my hometown and my birthday was a few months away so I snatched some before it was gone about two months prior.  I had tried it a few times.... maybe 10 or so trips within a month and a half or so.  Maybe a bit excessive looking back on it.  Anyway, my birthday came and went and I decided to hang with a friend the weekend after my birthday.  </p><p>Me and him were tripping this fine day in April and my fiance decided not to.  It was a beautiful day out and we decided to start indoors and go outside once things got 'colorful'.  I took 2.5 hits of blotter, and he had 2 hits.  </p><p>My medications include lithium and methimazole which is a Thyroid pill for hyperthyroidism.  I already hallucinate and hear things due to my mental illness which is either Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Schizoaffective Disorder.  However when I trip I'm able to escape the mental prison of voices that I have for at least a day which is great relief to me.  I should also mention that I've had many Research Chemical experiences and I think that played into today.</p><p>Back to the trip, I had taken as many as 8 of this batch with wonderful results about a month prior.  I took a month break from tripping to have no tolerance for my birthday experience.  I've always wanted a life changing experience, but on my own terms and I now know why these experiences come when I least expect them because they change me.</p><p>Ok, 30 min. to an hour is when it kicked in good.  Visuals were good, and we had started toking on a bowl 30 min. after taking the LSD.  At the one hour mark things had started to get crazy, especially after the bowl.  I wanted to go outside so I got up to go get my shoes.  As I was walking I thought I had stood up to fast because all of a sudden everything turned white and sound was so distorted and slowed down I thought I was passing out.  So my first instinct was to drop to the ground to minimize injury.  Every time I stood up past this point, that is what happened.  </p><p>T+1:15: </p><p>I was lying out on the floor.  I couldn't get up or move.  Something was wrong.  I could no longer see anyone or anything.  I could not hear anyone or anything.  I was literally gone.  This must've been a level 6!!!  Quickly things went from bad, to really really bad.  I started to lose consciousness, which didn't make sense.  I felt if I lost consciousness I was then dead because I can't overdose off of 2.5 hits, besides I tried 8 about a month prior.  The two people with me didn't know what to do.  I told my girl to call an ambulance because losing consciousness didn't seem right to me and if I was going to be bad off I wanted to be in the hospital where I felt safe and my family could be called to see me in the event of death.  </p><p>I haven't mentioned the visuals because that's all anybody ever talks about.  The visuals were more intense than salvia, I was literally in another world, seeing, touching, feeling another world.  I mostly saw me and my fiancé a lot, with little pot leafs floating in the background this was my picture of life and next was death.  </p><p>At this point I couldn't talk.  All I could do was spit out a bunch of jargon that made no sense.  I would cut to words in half and combine them to make new words.  The paramedics couldn't get any necessary info out of me other than, 'How many did you take?'  I said 2 or 3 and they flat out called me a liar and said 'You mean 6,7,8, 10!?! You didn't take 2 to get like this pal!!!'  </p><p>They couldn't believe what they were seeing.  At this point I thought I was on the edge of death, I kept going in and out of consciousness and it effected my trip each time.  I lost track of time because I couldn't see the world around me.  And then in the hospital I lay there, in my own world.  And I heard the Dr. say, 'It's too late, we've lost him.'  They start disconnecting the lines attached to me.  I begin to cry out my last words to my family and my girl, as I hold her hand... but I can't see anything that's really going on or hear anything that's going on.  And then I saw death, it was total and complete nothingness.  No conscious thought, no feeling, no nothing.  And then I proceeded to stop breathing as I went through death.  </p><p>During this time where I stopped breathing, it was brief, I made it to heaven and God gave me requirements in order to get my life back.  I was denied and then I was sent back to my body which was then discarded in a dump or where ever they keep masses of dead people.  And that's where any final thought dissipated.  </p><p>At this point my fiancé must've realized I wasn't breathing, I woke up to 'You're going to make it!'  This came out of the nurse holding my left hand and my girl was on my right.  I woke up to find all kinds of lines attached to me, and monitoring equipment.  I asked how long I was gone for..... my ER report showed I had been there for five and a half hours plus the half hour at home made for a 6 hour experience on the deep end. </p><p>It was a complete life altering experience, I'm 25 years old and the thought of never having kids really sucked.  I saw everything I'd miss out on.  I saw my funeral, and everyone who attended.  I've never experienced anything this intense and I've eaten 16 hits before.  When I was 18-19 years old, I liked LSD over everything and it was abundant.  </p><p>The one reason I sent this in was because me and another friend had some bad times... his on ecstasy.  But we both had one thing in common, we each used 2C's frequently for a 6 month period prior to both of us landing in the hospital.  I almost didn't come back, he almost died from bleeding in the brain.  I don't think the LSD was the main factor in such a profound trip, I think the 2C's set the stage, mostly 2CI.</p>"
