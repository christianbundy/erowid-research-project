Day 1 <br><br>
2 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT<br><br>
0:00  Consumed 2 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT from a gel capsule at the first night of a music festival. Tonight I was staying in the rave tent, listening and dancing to Bollywood style techno music.<br><br>
1:00  Felt mild sensations, enhancement of music<br><br>
2:00 - +1.5  Felt like I was rolling, with objects feeling very soft, and music enhancement<br><br>
4:00  Just felt slightly strange, didnt want to dance anymore, but walked around the campsites for an hour meeting new people<br><br>
Commentary:<br><br>
Although this drug didnt feel threatening, it didnt feel that interesting either. I agree with Shulgin that there probably isnt much to learn from this chemical, but I only had a +1.5 dose, so there may be more left to explore.<br><br>
I gave 4-5 mg of 5-MeO-MiPT to 4 friends to try. They said that the experience came in waves, some people felt overwhelmed at points, but they all said that they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. One friend felt out of it later in the day, but he had been drinking alcohol and hadnt slept much. <br><br>
Day 2<br><br>
10 mg 2C-E at 0:00<br><br>
10 mg 2C-E at 1:00<br><br>
3 bowls of cannabis at 2:00<br><br>
0:00  Laying on a hill, at a music festival with good bands, the sun is out, the weather feels nice. Its 1:00 PM, I consume 10mg of 2C-E from a gel capsule. I decided not to eat any food this day because I heard that 2C-E makes you nauseous.<br><br>
1:00  Dont really feel anything yet. Dont feel nauseous at all either, but it looks like a storm cloud is coming in. The wind increases, the weather gets cold. I dont know what to do, should I consume more? What if it rains? The sky got darker, and I could see the rain approaching us. But I had a feeling that the rain cloud would stop before it hit the festival hill. So I consumed 10 mg of 2C-E from a second gel capsule. The clouds dissipated, the sun came back out, and it turned out to be one of the most beautiful days in my life.<br><br>
2:00  Two hippie-chicks from Montana come to sit down next to me. I spark up conversation, tell them I just took 2C-E, but dont feel anything yet. So we start smoking some bowls of marijuana. After smoking the marijuana, I notice that the world looks like its in HD. Everything just looks crystal clear, and almost more real. No hallucinations though. Very clear-headed. +1<br><br>
2:30  The hippie-chicks leave to go to the spontaneous dance party that had begun. I start to feel the nausea people describe on this drug, but that may have been because I decided to eat food. However, it was very mild, and wasnt bad enough to negatively effect my trip. I just felt content laying in the grass, staring at the sky.<br>
I felt like I was viewing the world in a form that is more real than when I normally look at the world. I began to see patterns in the clouds, and the canyon, but I felt like they were real. It was as if I could see more, or comprehend more, or understand more, of the unspoken truth of nature. +2<br><br>
2:50  I began to have profound realizations about life, and nature.  I began to see patterns/rainbow outlines/ shifting shapes in the clouds. However, I couldnt separate hallucination from reality, because the clouds were constantly changing form in real life as well. To make matters worse, what I could tell were my hallucinations seemed to dictate how or where the clouds would move, or what shape they were about to turn into. To make matters even more worse, I could control my hallucinations, which would then control the clouds, and I literally began to shape the clouds with my mind. To top off everything, the hippie chicks had told me that changing the clouds shape with my mind was possible, and that it's called 'forming'. I began to attempt to theorize about how it could be possible to control cloud movement with my mind I concluded that there are forms of complex energy throughout the universe that we have yet to understand Something akin to God being somehow fundamental to everything in nature. But it was still only a +2<br><br>
6:00  Drug effects begin to decline, feel a little fryed, but nothing too bad. Much less so than using MDMA.<br><br>
Commentary:<br><br>
Overall a very clear-minded and pleasant experience. I understand why this is one of Shulgins magical half dozen. This compound has the potential to be used for spiritual growth, but if you are just looking for a high, this not for you. Although I wouldnt describe it as a full-on encounter with the other, it allows you to understand the beauty in nature, without an overwhelming psychedelic experience. I would highly recommend this to amateurs interested in exploring the psychedelic realm for the first time. I would also recommend using this during the daytime, in a natural setting. Again, I stress that the drug, in and of itself, will not enlighten you, but if used within the proper context, may allow for personal growth.<br><br><br>
Day 3<br><br>
20 mg of 2C-I at 0:00<br><br>
10 mg of 2C-I at 2:00<br><br>
Smoked cannabis at 4:00<br><br>
0:00  Consumed 2 pill capsules containing 2C-I a few hours before sunset. The flaming lips were scheduled to play an hour after my ingestion, and I assumed that they would be good music to listen to.<br><br>
1:00  I find myself in the middle of a crowd somewhat near the stage. I dont really feel anything yet.<br><br>
1:30  +1 I begin to notice a very slight enhancement of music, with colors looking a little more vivid, blue standing out very much. The concert was very beautiful and enjoyable<br><br>
2:00 - +1 I can feel the effects of this drug, but it is not very intense at all. Since I wanted to trip hard for modest mouse, I decide to take a third 10 mg pill of 2C-I. However, very soon after re-dosing I notice that I am actually at a +2. I see acid like visualizations.<br><br>
2:30 - +2 This drug is really starting to develop. It feels very similar to molly. Id describe it as if it were the psychedelic part of molly, but without the stimulate part. I began to see really beautiful visualizations, nothing that intense. I also had emotional feelings of love. Love for everyone and everything, but not an overpowering emotion. This is a love drug. I cant help but think about how incredible sex would be. An extremely sexy chick begins grinding on my back leg. It feels incredible. I feel this intense sexual energy between myself and her. Shes grinding with some guy who I assume to be her boyfriend, so I dont attempt to hook up with her, but wow. The unspoken emotional power of her touch is almost too much for me to handle. It feels better than an orgasm. The music is extremely enjoyable and I just dance to it.<br><br>
I remember at one point the lead singer comments on how important our hands are. I look at my hands, and they look incredibly beautiful. People around me must know that Im tripping on some drug.<br><br>
3:00  I still feel the effects of this drug, but my re-dose just allow me to maintain a good +2. I feel good, but at the same time I feel a little detached from the world. My sensory perceptions are on one the hand enhanced, while  on the other hand muffled. <br><br>
4:00  Still feel the effects, just jamming out to an amazing concert.<br><br>
8:00  The effects subside to the point where I could potentially sleep. Overall feel fryed from the weekend.<br><br>
Comments:<br><br>
This drug was enjoyable. Again, very mild psychedelic that doesnt fuck with the mind. I would recommend this to anybody going to a festival over acid or molly. However, I have no desire to use this drug again. It just wasnt enlightening like 2C-E, and I dont have reason to believe that 2C-I will further my spiritual growth. However, I would love to have sex while on this drug. The emotional connectivity that could be achieved would be absolutely mind-blowing. In fact, the incredible power of the sexual experience would be so intense that you should only use it with somebody you plan on marrying. I say that because it would probably be the most insane sexual experience imaginable, and something of that nature should be shared only with a soul-mate. The drug did give me an unpleasant taste in my mouth after about 4 hours, but it went away the next day. <br><br>
Overall Comments from the Weekend:<br><br>
Theres just something a little off about the synthetic phenethylamines. After using all of these drugs I did notice some pleasant and unpleasant physical side effects that are still present almost 2 weeks later. First of all, the world looked more colorful and in HD for the entire week after. Smoking weed brings flashbacks as well. There was a dull pressure in the front of my head that persisted after using 2C-I. Its not really painful, and virtually only comes up when I smoke. It probably has something to do with the of blood-flow. That worries me, because I dont want to get any brain damage. I had used molly twice within a two month period before my experiments, which probably contributed to the feelings as well. Also, Ive noticed a weird feeling in my heart, which has persisted since I used molly at 2 months earlier, but it is much worse now. I also feel a pressure in my wrists. Im not sure if it has to do with blood flow, increased blood pressure, or whatever. I remember feeling that pressure during my 2C-I trip, and flexing my hands to make it feel better. It potentially may have to do with muscles, or tendons, or nerve fibers in my wrist area. I had heard that 2C-I causes muscle tension, and the pressure that I still feel 2 weeks later may have to do with that. Ill just wait it out and hope the pressures go away. <br><br>
**Side note: Using 4-HO-MET made all of the negative side effects go away. For some reason tryptamines seem to reverse the negative side effects of phenethylamines. It has been 3 days since using the metocin, and literally all of the negative symptoms I described above are completely gone.<!-- End Body -->
