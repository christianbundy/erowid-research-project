 "report": "<p>\nI had never really done any drugs at all, except for occosianal weed or drinking.  One day I had basketball practice that I had to go to to play in the next game.  Well I had been up the night before and wanted to play, but I was really tired. I went home after school and told my brother who lifts weights that I was skipping it. He said he had these pills that would energize me, and it would be better than my plan of drinking 6 frappacinos and feeling all heavy.  </p><p>I took 4 pills, because that would not exeed the 24 hour limit.  Well one hour later after a sluggish warmup the pills kicked in.  My heart was beating so fast I thought I would die.  But I could run so damn fast and everything seemed kind of hazy. In a fast break drill someone missed a layup and I tipped dunked it with 2 hands, which I am but 5'9 and had never even dunked, except for after practices with a huge runup.  Everyone was noticing that I was leading every break and just had limiless energy. I just wanted to jump up and down. However I could not dribble because the jitters I suffered were terrible, and my mouth was extremly dry, and I could not really think straight.  </p><p>That day after practice I was still jittery and lightwieght, also I could not eat, food just seemed disgusting, and all I wanted to do is think.  That night I could not sleep cause I was so jittery and did not fall asleep until 6 in the morning.  I missed my first three periods, and went to school still feeling weird, although now it was a relaxed weirdness</p>"
