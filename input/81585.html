Background Information: I am an 18 year old female. I do not take any medications, or vitamen supplements.<br><br>
When visiting Scotland, I purchased one pack of legal highs called Doves from a head shop. Doves are made by a company called London Underground, and they are said to be safe alternatives to Ecstasy. They do not list the ingredients on the packaging.  <br><br>
7:00 PM - My boyfriend and I aren't really doing much tonight, so I decide to take the doves I've purchased. I decide this after I have eaten a full meal, so I know it'll probably take awhile to kick in. He decides to stay sober.<br><br>
I'm in a very good mood when I take the two pills. I feel excited and happy to be trying something new. My boyfriend and I at the time had our own room to stay in at a friend's house. The friend was out of town, so we were by ourselves.  <br><br>
8:00 PM - Not feeling anything. I'm guessing it's due to the full stomach.<br><br>
9:00 PM - Still not feeling anything. I'm starting think these are a scam.<br><br>
10:00 PM - Nothing. Convinced this must be a scam.<br><br>
11:00 PM - To my surprise, I start to feel more alert....Physical touch feels very similar to how MDMA feels, but other than that nothing.<br><br>
12:00 AM - My boyfriend and I decide to go to sleep. I still feel alert, but not enough so that I don't think I could fall asleep. As soon as I close the laptop I'm on, I feel as if I'm slammed with a strong chemical force, very similar to when MDMA hits me all at once. I tell my boyfriend that I am suddenly VERY high.  <br><br>
The high is similar to MDMA in many ways. I feel very happy, open, and empathetic. Physical sensation feels great, although I'm getting much worse dry mouth than I get with MDMA. The main difference I can find is that this high isn't very speedy. Though I do have a lot of energy, I definitely don't feel the need to get up and dance. I can also say that I feel very much so in control of myself, unlike sometimes on large doses of MDMA where I become an 'e-tard.' Another interesting side effect is that it's pretty hard for me to motivate myself to do anything like go up and get a glass of water. I did drink water while I was high, but not nearly as much as I should have. <br><br>
12:05 AM - Boyfriend and I have sex. After having sex (which, I will admit, was some of the best sex I've ever had, although I couldn't reach orgasm.) he passes out. <br><br>
1:00 AM - With nothing else to do, I go online and see that a good amount of my friends are online. I talk with them for most of the night and have good conversations with many of them.<br><br>
2:00 AM - Still very high.<br><br>
3:00 AM - Still feeling just as high as when it hits me. <br><br>
4:00 AM - This high lasts A LOT longer for me than with MDMA. I decide I like this more than actual MDMA due to it feeling more controllable but feeling just as good.<br><br>
5:00 AM - Starting to come down. The come down feels very natural, very light. I feel a little bit disappointed upon coming down, but not nearly as disappointed as with regular MDMA. I feel less motivated to tell people how much I love them or talk to them and start looking at things online.<br><br>
5:30 AM - Back to baseline, though feeling very awake. A little bit tired too. I decide to try and go to sleep, and go get into bed with my boyfriend. <br><br>
5:45 AM - My stomach is starting to hurt...Feels like a slight burning sensation. My breathing is becoming more noticeable. <br><br>
6:00 AM - Stomach is in IMMENSE amount of pain now. It feels like my entire chest is burning up. My breathing is now considerably more noticeable, to the point where I feel like I'm hyperventilating. I wake my boyfriend up. He holds me to try and calm me down, and I begin crying from the physical pain. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, so this is surprising even to me. Part of the crying could have also been due to fear because I didn't know what I had actually ingested.<br><br>
7:00 AM - The pain is still very intense, and I'm still crying. My boyfriend has to keep reminding me to drink water. I feel very light headed and am still having trouble breathing.<br><br>
7:45 AM - I can feel the pain starting to pass now.<br><br>
8:00 AM - Pain is mostly gone. Boyfriend and I decide to try and sleep. He passes out, and I remain awake.<br><br>
9:00 AM - Can't fall asleep. Boyfriend is out cold.<br><br>
10:00 AM - 12:00 PM Still awake. Boyfriend wakes up and leaves to make money street performing so we can buy food. I obviously chose to stay home. <br><br>
12:00 PM - 2:00 PM Go on the computer for awhile. Decide to try to sleep at about 2:00 PM. <br><br>
2:00 PM - 5:00 PM - Sleep. I am woken up by my boyfriend coming back. <br><br>
5:00 PM - 11:00 PM - Still feel decently tired, but am awake enough to go grocery shopping. We make food and spend time together till we go to sleep. I have no trouble falling asleep at this point. <br><br>
I feel back to normal the next day. However, three days after I have taken the drug, I experienced a horrible depression. I had to head back to Dublin that day to catch my returning flight so I was alone. I can barely pull myself out of my bed at the hostel I'm staying at. I can't remember a time where I felt this upset.  I have read about 'Tuesday blues', where MDMA users report that three days after they use MDMA they feel horrible. I acknowledge the possibility that I could have taken an MDMA analog when I took the doves, so it could cause a similar effect that MDMA would. I also took two hits of MDMA three weeks earlier, so that also could have contributed due to the fact my serotonin could still be in recovery mode. I return back to normal the next day.<br><br>
In summary, I will not be doing these ever again.<!-- End Body -->
