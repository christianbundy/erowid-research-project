 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Warning: Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.] </p><p>I had taken 300mgs of dxm in the form of corcidin cough and cold and another 300mgs with robitussin cough gels with a friend of mine and went to sell plasma with my friend later that day about 4 houtrs after the trip wore off. Now they do not urine drug test when you donate but once they have your plasma they run drug tests along with HIV and what not. So I sold my plasma and got my money and went along my marry way. </p><p>About a month or so later I got a letter in the mail from them that reqested me to come in for a counseltation fearing the worst that I could have hiv I went in and spoke to the people there they relayed to me that I would no longer be able to donate due to high ammounts of PCP(!!)in my blood. I tried to use the medicinal use of dxm but they told me that while possible to false positive the ammounts in my system could no be from a legetimate use and told me sorry and I could no longer donate.</p>"
