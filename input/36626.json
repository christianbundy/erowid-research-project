 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nMost of this night, I honestly don't recall and had to be pieced together slowly over a week by myself, friends, and a police report. \r\nIt started out just like any other night, we were hanging out at a friend's place. That summer we spent a lot of time at his place smoking pot, drinking, and just generally having fun since it was the summer after we had graduated. We got bored one night after having smoked a few bowls and one of my friends mentioned Dramamine. Having never heard of it being used in terms of a drug, we all decided to give it a try. It was probably about 8 o' clock in the evening and we drove to the store and picked some up, two bottles for each of us. There were three of us by the way. So we went back to our hangout and all of us took what we had. \r\nWe threw a movie and sat back to enjoy it. I think it probably took about 15-20 minutes for it to hit me. I can't remember much of being in the apartment aside from talking to my friend's mom about all sorts of jibberish, and noticing a lot of changes in light and shadows. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  One of the guys decided to leave because he was tired and it wasn't doing much to him (we later discovered that while driving home he kept swerving to miss imaginary semi-trucks and once he got home he sat in the dark in his room and had imaginary talks to people who weren't there.) \r\nWe'll call my friend Joe from here on out for reasons of privacy. So from what Joe told me the next day, I sat on the couch in his apartment and talked to him as if he were an employee at the local bookstore where I had worked, most of what I said was total jibberish and quiet mumbling, yet all the time I thought I was speaking very clearly in my mind. After awhile I got up and tried to pick up and a plant that was behind the couch, saying that it wasn't supposed to be there so I had to get rid of it. Joe finally got me to calm down about that and sat me back down on the couch, where I started to talk about how I had killed 'them' and hid the bodies in my basement. From what he's told me, I changed completely when I spoke of that, I had an evil tone to my voice and kept talking about how they deserved the death I gave them and how I had butchered the bodies. \r\nSo at that point, he freaked out (the drug didn't seem to affect him for some reason, well, not as much) and all he wanted was for me to get out of his house. So we decided to leave and go to a local coffee house. Bad idea. We wound up driving around downtown for an hour or so, I wound up nearly killing us because I failed to realize that I was driving at about 40 mph right at a flat-bed trailer. He decided that it was time for him to drive because I couldn't handle it. I guess that's when I really started to freak out. He pulled into a parking place across the street from the coffee-house and I guess in my mind I thought the car wasn't stopping, and I freaked out and began stomping my feet into the floorboards of the car and smashing my hands on the dashboard, in a frantic attempt to try and stop the car. For some odd reason, even at all of that, we still decided to go into the coffee house. \r\nWe got in, and everything seemed like it was getting better. I felt like I was regaining control of myself, unknown to me, the worst had yet to come. I wound up standing on the stairs to the upper level of the coffeehouse for about 5 minutes staring around blankly until Joe realized I wasn't with him and came back down and got me. As we passed a group of people our age, Joe sad that I walked up to a random girl and just started talking to her as if I had known her for years. \r\nShe got worried about me for some reason that I'll never understand and asked Joe if I was alright and if I needed to sit down. Joe claimed I was ok and we headed to the balcony for a smoke. From here on out this is where things really started to get to me. I had really hallucinated much before this point in the night. But I wound up lighting a cigarette and dropping it at some point onto the metal grate balcony and I spent about 20 minutes on my hands and knee's searching for the cigarette. From what Joe said, I still had the cigarette in my mouth the entire time. \r\nSo finally, after getting all sorts of disapproving looks from the owner and employee's, we decided to leave. Or rather Joe decided to leave and I wandered along after him confused as to where I was. Now, from this point on, I remember nothing but very small pieces of time. I remember going back to Joe's place, and deciding to leave, and getting in my car and backing up and leaving. From what Joe said, he and I got into an argument about me leaving, and I jumped in my car, threw it in reverse, backed up and then turned the car off and took the keys out. He watched from a window in his apartment and came out and asked me what I was doing. I told him I was leaving, and he explained to me that my keys weren't even in my ignition. So after a few times of this happening I finally made it out of the apartment complex. \r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]\r\nI made it only about 100 yards down the road though, because I managed to drive in-between some construction barriers and into a construction zone. As far as I can figure, I got out of my car to make sure it was ok, locked it, and threw the keys on a nearby barrier as I walked around the car looking at it. From there I think I must have gotten confused as to why my car was locked and where my keys were, so I started wandering around town. \r\nI remember walking up to a house and knocking on the door, thinking it was one of my buddy's houses. I was so wrapped up in this fantasy world that I even saw his little brother let me in. From there, the police report details that I was found in a family's home standing in front of their fish tank trying to open it to get a drink of water because I was so thirsty. The home-owner asked me what I was doing and I replied that I was thirsty and wanted some water, so I came in to get a glass. She freaked out and told me to leave, and I wandered over to their christmas tree and plucked a bulb off the tree and turned to her proclaiming 'oh this is pretty, I think I'll take this.' From there, I remember some small tid-bits of people yelling 'call the cops, call grandpa, get out of my house' and other numerous screams. So I ran. They found me on a porch a few blocks away crying and trying to write something with an imaginary pencil on some imaginary paper. \r\nThe police cuffed me and questioned me and all they could get out of me was that it was about 8 o' clock still, when it was really around 11:30 now, and that I had just left work a few moments ago. One of the officers also informed me the next day that I had repeatedly spoke to him as if he was an employee at the bookstore I was employed at and if he thought it would be ok for me to make a cup of tea. They arrested me on the grounds that I had unlawfully entered a person's home, and that I was completely unaware to my surroundings and was a danger to myself and others. \r\nAt this point, I remember a few things about being in the jailhouse, I remember sitting in the fingerprinting room, trying to read an issue of Cosmo that was sitting on my lap, and the entire time all the officers saw was my handcuffed to a chair trying to reach the magazine so I could turn the pages. I remember freaking out when the magazine fell off my lap and disappeared completely. That was the first time that I got scared, because I realized some of what the drug was doing to me. So from there, they put me in a holding cell, in which I saw about a half a dozen friends who were really there, held a conversation with one, told a rather large grizzled black man to shut the hell up and leave me alone and then had to be removed from the cell for my own safety. \r\nAn officer stated in the police report that when they removed me from the cell, I was ranting and raving about dead bodies rising up out of the floor and how I thought the entire police precinct was positioned over an entry gate to hell. \r\nI really honestly can't remember anything else about the rest of the night, aside from one of the officers who had decided to somewhat take me under his wing and make sure I was ok, checking in on me periodically. Around 11 the next morning, my name was yelled through an intercom and I woke up and rushed out of the cell, forgetting my shoes completely, which pissed the cop off. So he told me to sign some papers, and I got confused and asked him what they were for, because I didn't want to sign a legal document without knowing what it was for. So he asked me if I wanted to stay here or get out of here, so I quickly signed the papers. \r\nI was told to walk through the next three blue doors, and bam, I was outside in the sunlight, groggy, sweaty and totally unaware of what I was going to do next. I had no idea of where my car was, or how I would even find it. \r\nSome bits and pieces of the night in the cell came back to me over the course of the next week, I remember a cold disgusting breakfast, smoking numerous imaginary cigarettes and then freaking out and crying when they disappeared and I would realize that I was hallucinating. I remember there being numerous other people in the cell with me. Over the course of the night, they messed with me, and when I awoke in the morning, I thought I was going to be charged with 26 counts of manslaughter for driving my car into a school, and for assaulting a police officer.\r\nIn the end, I got a minor misdemeanor charge and a lot of probation. \r\nSadly, I'm an idiot, and this wasn't my last encounter with dramamine.\n\n\n"
