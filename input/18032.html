Marijuana is a substance of fleeting effect. It has been used for centuries by millions for numerous reasons, and has been a topic of developed discussion on many levels; including medical, philosophical, and spiritual levels. Still, after its massively widespread use, marijuanas specific effects and use remain a mystery even to its most serious supporters. It is well established that after taking a dose of marijuana, one feels enthused with his/her existence, relaxed, and euphoric at times, but the specifics of these effects have been hard to focus in upon. It is through my effort here that I wish to provide scientific documentation on the psychological effects a dose of cannabis has upon my body, and the varying sensations that my body is stricken with throughout the progress of my session.<br><br>
Due to legal issues, my study will, unfortunately, be quite unscientific. I have, as a medium, this computer, on which I will record in 10-minute intervals the exact sensations, emotions, and varying temperaments I may come to experience. I also have my personal webcam, on which I will record, at significant legal risk, my actions within my room. This document will most certainly be kept secure, as its public release would be a massive legal liability.<br><br>
Finally, I am making preparations to address the specific cravings and effects of various audio stimulation throughout my experience. As a somewhat seasoned stoner, if you will, I am quite familiar with the dramatic effects of music upon a person while in the midst of a marijuana-induced high. In the same manner, a variety of food and drink will also be provided.<br><br>
And thus, let us begin with some previously-acquired data:<br><br>
Name: Aes<br>
Age: 15<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Height: 59<br>
Weight: 128 lbs.<br><br>
7.45 am - Smoking began. 0.25 grams of moderate quality acquired in New Jersey, USA by means of a two-car trade off, beginning in New York City, USA, where it was grown.<br><br>
7.55 - I am, at the moment, filled with a deep psychological pressure to make haste and finish my work so I have time remaining to clean up my smoking tools, as well as a fear of being caught red-handed by a number of my superiors. I repeatedly picture them coming to my door in my mind, and they each, for some reason unknown, have face and body textures very similar to those of the Simpsons television characters. I must make haste to clean up, I will return. <br><br>
8.00 - I have returned, supplies hidden, and have been recently staggered by the discovery of a sixth plane of sense. I can, not by means of any other sense, detect the presence of non-incandescent light, specific pressure in different places, and scents upon myself, my clothes, and objects I am directly touching by skin alone. I seem to have gained a new way of thinking, but slightly written over previous objects in my mind. Hence a retarded expansion of thought. I must beg the readers pardon on any confusion caused by my part. I am quite intoxicated at the moment.<br><br>
8.04 - I am still going up, believably. When I close my eyes, I can view coloured graph-generated lines forming pictures of what I can see in my mind. I seem to type by predicting giant mathematical patterns in my mind outlined by these wires. This sensation cannot be grasped by anyone who has never used marijuana. I just feel happy and content, yet massively hungry and thirsty. I also feel satisfied with myself for the labour required to purchase this bowl. And I just completed my inhalation of the first bowl of chips. The world around me seems fascinatingly dynamic, and I am filled with an urge to rush out and behold of its beauty, but I must hold fast. I will return, with a plant from it to satisfy me. Oh, and food.<br><br>
8.11- I have returned, with Triscuits, green tea, and a small cactus. I choke upon a dry Triscuit, and I feel waves of discomfort flowing through my body, but it only makes me feel more tired and nature-acclimated. Once again, I fear being apprehended as my small marijuana stash container is still left on the table. My thoughts move fast, but my body feels as though a racing car in one of those bond movies is chasing him, and hes flying downhill. I also feel an earthy attachment to my car. Anyway, on the physical sign, I now see a psychedelic cloud with earthy video-game tones in it and I feel very close to nature. I am now very warm everywhere, and greatly stimulated to relax..<br><br>
8.14 - As my watch beeps the time, I struggle for exterior contact for no reason. I wish to call someone, and speak aloud, Damn, everyones at school. I crave salty food and inhale some more Triscuits, but then take a fearful swig of green tea. The life existing around me feels so beautiful, I wish to clad myself in clothes much in its colour and natural patterns, and go out into it where I can experience the beauty of music and love right in its deepest deaths. I feel as though the world has just thrust upon me the key to life in this marvelous cannabis experience and wishes me to emerge from the world relaxed and rejuvenated. I require a different musical selection now, and I restart my webcam.<br><br>
8.21- Euphoric is the only way I can describe my situation. Its save time. Nirvana deeply connects to my soul, I feel like an artist. I wish strongly to play my bass or guitar, but I deeply crave to just listen to what I am doing in my experiment. I feel empowered by the grunge music on, and feel much empathy towards Kurt Cobain.<br><br>
8.24 - Still stoned, my world is surrounded by colours. The cactus represents Mickey Mouse in quite a severe manner. I wish to present it to the camera.<br><br>
8.27 - A sudden burst of hilarious ridiculous action hits my body like a truck, but I gain control. For some reason, I continued to move my body as though I was laughing, but did not maintain the facial expression or focus at all. I feel as though my ears are being pulled down in a sensual way by the lobes. I also feel a wonderful sensual pressure by pressing upon my temples. I must now go outside, I will report back.<br><br>
8.34 - Still stoned. I am starting to begin to come down, but it is slow and gradual. Time seems to flow slowly. I am feeling alright as so many smokers before me have said. I for some reason feel as though smoking has brightened and improved my life, rather than acting in a negative, dirty way as I might unfortunately consider while not high. At the moment, I feel happy, content, and sleepy. I wish nothing more than to pass out on my bed, but I feel dedicated to staying awake to further my study. All colours currently associated with nature. I am now filled with fear, as I see a blue light entering my room. I rush to the window, expecting to see an officer to arrest me, and see nothing. So I lock my door and turn down the music. <br><br>
8.39 - I am amazed that Ive only been high for 40 minutes, it feels as though it was an eternity, considering the movement of the sun over the earth has been dramatic, and my mood has changed so deeply. I am really stoned now, and am experiencing a euphoric full-body buzz, as so many of us have heard described. I consider going out for Chinese food, as fried rice with little pieces of meat sounds amazing. Maybe I will order it, they couldnt be too upset, eh? Maybe some spare ribs too. Oh, shit, no delivery. Damn, I wish they delivered everything. Or they had like a totally automated method for delivering all food, where like everything would be kept in giant metal containers or something. Wow, I just had a total out-of-body experience, I feel content and happy with everything the world has to offer, and am thrilled with the thought of my article being enjoyed worldwide.<br><br>
8.44 - Still stoned. I realize I repeat still stoned often. I now must play Mechwarrior 4, the thought of piloting a gigantic robot fascinates me.<br><br>
9.24 - Amazing program, really. I seem to be suffering from a significant loss of concentration, currently, and need to browse the web, but I am overdue on a report. My head is heavy, and my eyes are tired. I have a mild headache, but my entire body feels tingly nerve stimulation. My entire vision is a floating blur. Colours are vibrant but primarily green in base (all of them). I feel relaxed, happy, and accomplished. Thirst is very strong, with hunger waning. All thought is very random and brief, and seems to bounce disconnectedly.<br><br>
10.05 - After a significantly long Diablo II session, I now feel relaxed and tingly all over, and desire sleep deeply. Time seems to move very slowly, reggae music is highly stimulating, and all colour is bright and wavy. That is the only word I can come up with to describe it. I feel gentle and very sincerely nature-acclimated once again. I feel accomplished.<br><br>
10.20 - End of study. I now just feel warm and content, and this feeling continues for an average period of approximately 6 hours (until 4.20 in the afternoon, in this case). <br><br>
The next day - I feel refreshed, alert, and have a slightly lacking memory of yesterday, but I associate a very positive and natural feeling towards it. I feel less stressed than usual, but feel, aside, absolutely normal, if slightly more inspired and focused.<br><br>
Thank you for reading my study, It is my sincerest hope it has proved an interesting resource. <br><br>
