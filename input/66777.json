 "report": "<p>We were invited to partake in the magic of the cactus. Z.C had boiled it all down, so that a dose of 1/2 a metre of a cactus equaled 1 shot glass. We downed our shots with some grapefruit juice.</p><p>Soon everyone except me started feeling a bit ill and eventually they had all thrown-up outside in the garden. Eventually I threw up as well.  It was beautiful.  Through-out the night we each had our own puke spot where we'd return to at least two times.</p><p>ZC was the first to feel it.  He turned to me, Anna and Sua and announced that the wood-grain cupboards looked awesome, pulled up a chair, sat down and continued to stare at it, like one would watch a television set! The girls laughed at him, but I knew that we would probably join him in a few minutes, for I have had the pleasure of experiencing san pedro before. A while later and we also started to feel it,  to see it.  Its like LSD but different.  Inanimate objects move, bend, warp and theres colours all over the place.  If I closed my eyes I would continue to see the most wonderful winamp visualization-like visuals!</p><p>Were all a bit different, like being drunkish, care-free etc.  So we decide that it was a beautiful night and we moved the bed outside, so that we could all lie on the bed while looking at the fire, which contained scenes of fire elves and dwarfs.  Anna said that the stars looked like they were hanging from strings.  We used a kaleidoscope and binoculars to further trip out on the amazing stars above.</p><p>Eventually we moved the whole bed back into the house.  All four of us managed to lie on it and the girls became so very lazy.  They would keep on saying that their limbs were like the roots of a tree and that they became attached to the bed or whatever they were sitting/lying on.  While lying on the bed, next to or on Anna, our arms felt and became like those of a spider, our arms were soooo long and wed get tangled and confused Whos arm is this? Mine? Yours?</p><p>We had lots of fun for a couple of hours, but later things just got bad for me.  It felt like it was just too chaotic in there, with all 4 of us talking in that small room.  so I decide to take a breather outside, and the moment I stepped outside I was his with the contrast of the beautiful scenery, the soft, grey tones of the outside world, the birds and the just the calm and pleasant sound of the earth.  It was such a big difference from the craziness inside that I closed the sliding door behind me and walked into the night.</p><p>Then I started spinning around and around and when I stopped the whole world wobbled AND off course everything was still painted with pulsating colours.  It was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced and decided I had to tell all of them!  So I ran inside and told them that they should also come and spin and that it was awesome.  They all just looked at me as if I was talking nonsense.  This upset me and I went back outside and when no-one came outside I started to believe that they (including my girlfriend Anna!) were all against me.  This feeling continued to grow until I couldnt bring myself to go back anymore!  And the longer I stayed outside the more I believed the enemy were plotting and scheming against me!</p><p>Then something WEIRD happened!  It was as if I had experienced this Me against them feeling before, as a child perhaps, and I relived this unknown, unexplained episode!  I fell to my knees on the grass, in fear and confusion!  Then Anna came out, totally oblivious to my situation, and when I saw her it was a mixture of happiness but it was also SO confusing!  I wanted to greet her with a smile but at the same time it felt like we just had a HUGE fight!!  I was really bit confused there, eesh!  When I explained to her what had happened she told me that Im just tripping and that NO-ONE was mad or against me and that I should come back inside with them.  I did, but I was still a bit pissed off because they didnt do the awesome spin thing.</p><p>The night continued with its craziness, swirling colours and such.  At this point everything was still cool.  But later, I think it just went on for too long.  It felt like we couldnt communicate anymore.  We would all just talk in circles, we never got to any conclusions.  Id start off saying something and then stop half-way.  I hated it, but there was NO way to communicate it!</p><p>This trip lasted forever! By the time the sun was rising (10? hours already) we were all so tired, but we couldnt sleep.  I had racing thought in my head.  Anna had an assignment (university) to listen to some program on a certain radio station, but as we were still quite bent we could go home and she had to submit us all to the torture, the radio program was this preacher that went on about how you are damned to hell if you have heard the gospel but do not believe!  It freaked me out and it was horrible to be listening to that while in the condition we were!</p><p>Eventually we were good enough to drive (12 hours! the trip lasted 12 hours!!!) and we went to the river for a while to wind down.  It was long before we could actually sleep.</p>"
