 "report": "<p>I read about S. Capensis online in the context of my research into Oneirogenic plants and eventually ordered 25 grams of dried whole root from an online vendor along with 50 grams of C. Zacetechichi.</p><p>I discovered that traditionally the Silene roots would be ground to a powder *about a table spoon* which would be mixed with water and frothed with a forked stick to produce a thick foam that is sucked off the liquid in the morning prior to exercise and then again before bed. Supposedly the liquid can be repeatedly frothed over the course of a few days without the addition of more roots, however the hard but flexible nature of the roots make them extremely difficult to powder, the best I was able to do was create very fine shavings that would discolor water to an off white/cream but not cause it to produce foam. Ultimately the texture of the roots lends itself well to chewing and anybody who ate liquorice root as a child should enjoy this, the taste is very mild and slightly reminiscent of pot pourri but in a good way. </p><p>Initially I began chewing and swallowing a few small roots each night before bed as well as drinking a tea made from the ground roots in the morning, at the same time I would also drink a mug of Calea tea and smoke a joint of Calea before bed and for 4 days this produced no effects whatsoever on my sleeping state. </p><p>At this point let me draw your attention to the fact that Calea REALLY does taste as bad as everybody says, I often find that people are pretty over dramatic about how bitter or foul tasting plants are but I was STUNNED by Calea, it really is fucking nasty, like the taste of paracetamol tablets x100000000 mixed with lawn clippings. People often suggest adding sugar but i didn't even bother, it seems about as pointless as icing a dog shit. The only thing that helps is drinking it cold.</p><p>Anyway, for four days I didn't experience anything significant so I arbitrarily decided to discontinue the Calea and that very night my dreams became more vivid, lucid and epic than they ever have been in my life, each night afterwards when only Chewing Silene roots I would fall asleep quickly and experience the most remarkable dreams of my life. As such I am forced to conclude that Calea works against Silene somehow.</p><p>With regards to the Silene roots it is well worth noting that there is no form of hangover whatsoever when I wake up and in fact I find I awake feeling far more refreshed and energized when I use this root. </p><p>Something else that interested me about the Silene roots is that they are traditionally believed to grant you access to the 'white ways' where you may receive communications from your ancestors and sure enough the very first dream this plant induced was set in heavy snow casting a white light everywhere and two muslim men where telling me all about Ramadan. I am Scottish but my Clan has origins amongst the Moors of Morocco who are Muslim. Probably a coincidence.</p><p>After a while I decided to try using Calea on its own and was underwhelmed after the Silene roots, apart from tasting like crap I actually find that Calea tends to keep me awake with a strong sensation of my body being extremely tired but my mind rushing, eventually I fall asleep and SOMETIMES have memorable dreams but they tend to to be less vivid and slightly 'delirious'. Calea also gives me a hangover, I will often wake up with a mild headache and feel sedated for the rest of the day. </p><p>Over all I would strongly recommend Silene capensis for anybody who loves to dream, it really is awe inspiring. </p><p>[Reported dose: 3-5 small 3 cm length roots each night *chewed*]</p>"
