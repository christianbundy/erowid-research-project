 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI realized there was an abundance of Coleus in my school greenhouse. I quickly gained interest. Once I was sure of its effects and how to 'do' it, I was on my way. The next day at school I took just 2 medium sized, almost completely red leaves with just a bit of light whitish-green around the outside. They were very beautiful looking. I rolled them up and carefully stuck them in my backpack for when I got home.\r\nI took a couple fairly big leaves just so I could see if there were any effects at all before I went smoking large amounts.\r\nWhen I got home I broke the leaves up into pieces so they could be dried. I took an oil incense burner and took the bowl off the top and replaced it with a sheet of tinfoil (tea candle underneath, tin foil held up about 3 inches from the candle. I put the pieces on the tin foil, rotating them every once and a while. Once all the pieces were dried out I put them into a container for about an hour until I was ready to smoke it.\r\nWhen I was ready I rolled an L-Pape style joint out of it which came out to what would have been a NICE sized cone for a one person marijuana session that would get me pretty high. \r\nI proceeded to smoke the joint. After the first few pulls I noticed that my heart felt like it was going to explode out of my chest. It wasnt racing, just felt like it was beating REALLY hard. It kind of scared me because I'm a big guy and I was worried about a heart problem. I quickly calmed myself down and watched my chest vibrate as I finished the joint.\r\nAt first I was kind of disappointed because I didn't think it was working. If anything I had a slight contact high like one feels when being around a lot of stoned people.\r\nThe next little while was strange... after about 5-10 minutes while I was reading something my vision went a bit blurry, like when one looks at a computer screen for a really long time, but I had only been looking at it for a little while cuz before hand I was busy with my coleus smoking. Upon looking around my room I noticed that it wouldnt go away.\r\nAt this point I was excited because it was starting to kick in. After the next 10-15 minutes I started to feel extremely happy, and my body was all FUZZY (thats the only way to describe it). All I could do was smile, and the whole time I felt like laughing, but I couldnt. I just had that pressure feeling in my throat like when Im about to laugh. on top of that, EVERYTHING had an aura (a glowing color around the object), and everything had a different one. And to my eyes, my skin looked blue and green around the edges of my limbs.\r\nAfter the effects set in I decided it was a good time to watch Beavis & Butthead and enjoy my high. While watching this, the effects kicked in even more. my computer screen started to warp, and shift around as if it were but a puff of smoke. not to mention I couldnt focus on anything, and when I tried I'd zone out and go cross eyed, but the main thing (usually beavis/buttheads face) was clear as day. At some point I called my friend, it made me realize how messed up I was I was talking like I had just smoked a blunt to my face.\r\nThe high lasted for a good couple hours, fading out slowly. But the annoying blurry vision stayed for a while. All in all it was a really fun experience.\n\n\n"
