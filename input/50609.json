 "report": "<p>I have long been interested in the various psychoactive snuff mixtures of South America. However, inhaling crushed, potentially toxic seed matter mixed with alkaline lime (no wonder people say it burns their nose!) did not sound like a lot of fun to me. I decided it was both safer and more pleasant to attempt to smoke Anadenanthera. I reasoned that the effects from smoking the seeds should still be relatively intense, but I could control the dosage better and thereby avoid any potentially toxic reactions due to bufotenine in the seeds.</p><p>I took just a single medium-sized example of the strangely flattened, brown seeds and crushed in a mortar and pestle. The brown seed coat proved to be a thin, flaky material that separated easily from the creamy coloured endosperm and embryo inside. Both the brown seed coat and the white seed interior were placed into the bowl of a bong filled with water. I stilis), except for the somewhat worrying burning/clutching feeling I had in my throat when first inhaling the smoke. It felt rather scary, and I was worried that I was having a toxic reaction to bufotenine present in the seeds. The heavy sweating I noticed is also consistent with the effects of bufotenine. I also found Anadenanthera to have a strong sedative effect, which I was not extook a moment to prepare myself and mentally asked the seeds to be my ally. I lit a lighter and sucked the flame down onto the seed material. Most of the brown seed coat burned right away, with a series of crackling and sparking sounds. As I continued to inhale, I had this bizarre clenching and tingling sensation in my throat, and then within seconds I felt an overwhelming dizzying rush and had to practically lie down on the floor. The world dissolved into little flashing sparks for a few seconds, and then I regained my sight and felt a strong spinning sensation. I sat back up and breathed in the smoke of the seeds three more times. Each time I got a slight feeling of dizzyness and a sensation that my body was disintegrating. My limbs felt numb and tingly. I also could not feel the smoke as it was going down my throat.</p><p>After smoking the seeds I was left in an almost stupor-like state. Everything I saw was waving and moving in my vision, and when I closed my eyes I had a strong sensation of spinning and falling. I was also sweating somewhat heavily, and had a strong sedated, lethargic feeling. All I could do was lie on my bed, alternatively opening and then closing my eyes when either the visual distortions or the spinning sensation became too strong for comfort. This lasted for about 30 minutes, after which point I returned rapidly to a somewhat 'normal' feeling. Soon afterwards I went to sleep, and there were no discernible aftereffects by morning.</p><p>The overall feeling of Anadenanthera was similar to other tryptamine bearing plants that I have smoked (Phalaris arundinacea and Mimosa hopecting as other tryptamines generally have stimulant effects. But Anadenanthera made me feel quite sedated and did not seem to increase my heart rate at all. The effects of smoking even just the one seed were very strong, and Anadenanthera definately seems to be one of the most potent sources of tryptamine alkaloids. I'm not sure whether I will try Anadenanthera again, because the effects just felt a little too toxic for my liking. I am planting the rest of my seeds to grow this very beautiful plant.</p>"
