6:15pm: Dosed with my friend. 20-23mg.<br><br>
7:15pm: No changes. Went downtown for New Years. Nothing yet. <br><br>
8:00pm: Fireworks start. From the 19th floor of an office building, the city looks strange, glowing in a way that seems almost foggy and surreal. An intense nausea hits me. Fireworks are stunning but I am distracted by worrying about if and when I am going to vomit. <br><br>
8:05pm: Leave to go throw up in the bathroom. Hallucinations hit me like a brick, kaleidoscopic patterns in the tiles, toilet paper roll expanding as if wet and then shrinking, edges growing and reaching outwards. The toilet appears to 'Yawn' as I bend over it. My body hurts.<br><br>
8:15pm: We walk home. The entire time I feel sick and keep waiting to throw up. When we get home, the hallucinations are very intense. Much like mushrooms, object appear to ripple, glow, melt, warp, breathe, and bulge. I finally vomit. A lot. I notice that unlike mushrooms and other psychedelics, there is no mental fog or distortion of emotion. Everything is very clear. It comforts me that I can communicate and act totally normal, despite the fact that what I am seeing is very much not in reality at all.<br><br>
8:30pm: Things shimmer. Objects like carpet become almost like reflective surfaces. I see shining things dart past my field of vision like fireflies. There is a distinct lag of moving objects. If I move my hand in front of my face, there is a blur, like lights leave in the darkness when they move quickly. At one point, I have to lie down and focus on one specific thing because looking at something broad, like an entire room, is overwhelming. I am very dizzy, and still extremely nauseous, although there is nothing left in my stomach to expel. My friend says he feels the same. I become extremely cold and shiver uncontrollably. <br><br>
8:45pm: We leave to go his friends house. I throw up again before we go, and am still not relieved of my nausea and physical discomfort. When I look in the mirror, my pupils are like dish plates, but I can only look at them for a few seconds before they begin to bulge, melt, and slowly droop down the rest of my face. Strange... <br><br>
9:00-11:00pm: Colours are outstanding. The visuals are still very strong, but no longer overwhelming. The nausea passes in intervals before coming back again. It's a very unwelcome distraction from the hallucinations. I watch a Hendrix poster as the colours undulate, transitioning from muted to explosive. The red looks like brilliant fire, the blue becomes like a sage green, then back to white, then to blue again. A 40 year old virgin poster is rather strange... I am fascinated by Steve Carells face melting off, leaving just a bare skeletal outline with skin plastered over it, wearing a grimacing smile as his eyes twist around in his head, sometimes staring at me. I decide this is bad energy and focus on something else. It's not upsetting though, as I said before, there is no distortion of emotion or extreme focus on positive and negative energies. Emotion is not influenced by these things. <br><br>
I prefer to not talk during the experience, but it is not difficult to communicate when I want to. I appear totally lucid, save my wandering and fascinated eyes. My neck hurts very badly, as if it is holding a lot of tension. Finally I lie down to ease some of this discomfort. It works momentarily. I find that I cannot get in a comfortable position no matter what I do. I play with a very small kitten. It's fur expands and contracts, making it appear like a breathing puffball. <br><br>
12:00pm: Happy New Years! Hallucinations are almost entirely gone. I can't remember when they ceased but they have, almost as instantaneously as they occurred. <br><br>
General Notes: I feel that there is very little 'come up' and 'come down' with this drug. It hits me without notice, and with much force, and leaves just as quickly. Four hours was a good time period for this drug to be in my system, as it is quite overwhelming and uncomfortable at times. The nausea and vomiting definitely put a damper on the experience as a whole, although I don't regret trying this out. <br><br>
The lucidity and clarity of it prevented me from getting 'positive' or 'negative' with the experience. It simply 'was.' At the same time, it made me focus more on the 'reality' of the situation and lacked the mystical element that, for example, shrooms have. I would say to anyone trying this for the first time to make sure you're in a situation where you can easily make it to the bathroom in case you need to vomit. There was no body high or physical sensation heightening, but there was a significant bodily discomfort that I think most people experience in their stomach. Good luck.<!-- End Body -->
