 "report": "<p>\nWell.....theres so much i can go on and on about on this issue.  Starting off i used 'G' only because of my peers were so 'UP' on it and telling me its good for you and blah blah. I'm a big fan of rolling, drinking, smoking weed etc. They were peers so i gave it a shot. Well at first it didn't seem like too much just made me up and horny as u know what. White lightning was the name of the stuff i was using. Anyways it went and came but one day i ran into a supplier of this stuff and he offered me very good deals and even fronted me a little atf a time to make myself some money. It was going all well and everthing and i took the time to research this on the computer (kinda hard to find gbl though...mostly only 'GHB')and even ran copies of it to my friends who didn't believe that if used properly this stuff wasnt bad. </p><p>Well i guess i kinda got carried away with it since i always had large amounts and could afford to drink it like water (not literally) Well let me tell you real quick as im writing this im still trying to cope from my addiction. It was getting to where i couldnt even fall asleep anymore, seriously. I starting getting this difficulty of not wanting to go out much anymore because id get soooo hot. Last week was the worst ex.!! I tried to sleep but couldnt lay still. I took a little bit more in hopes to fall asleep (already been up 2 days and prior getting 3-4 hours of sleep rather than my reg 8-10 when I wasn't on the stuff.</p><p>Well i had a very bad week. Worst week of my life. I even started sweating this stuff through my skin seriously!!!! Instead of water 'G' would run and it gave me an uncomfortable tingly and hair stanting experience. Also the first day without it i shook and had the high blood pressure and heart beat. And taking sleeping pills only made it worse. I had no way to escape it. And like i said im still suffering as i write. TO ANYONE who uses this please do it moderatly. I still sell it to people but i dont sell to where i think they have a chance they can end up like me. They love it!!!! Just be cautious and make sure to read all the facts not just the good ones.</p>"
