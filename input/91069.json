 "report": "<p>8:00 eat 160 mg of butylone on a mostly empty stomach. Already high on marijuana.</p><p>8:15 perhaps some increase in energy, a mild but very clean stimulation, or perhaps placebo</p><p>8:25 still not much</p><p>8:35 stimulation increasing, mild euphoria seems to be building.</p><p>8:40 smoking a bowl of marijuana and this seems to be bring it on. As it is, this feels like quite a stoning high. To be honest not as strong as I was expecting, specifically, ive read this a very tweaky chem but it doesnt appear to be especially so. Very clean stimulation though, nothing indicates significant serotonin or catecholamines release. Not particularly rushy either, at least not at this dose. </p><p>8:50 Gaining intensity... I can see it now, the rushy aspect of this drug and this is also a very heavy stimulation... heart, for now, is fine though.</p><p>8:55 feeling fucking fantastic... id say this is closer to meth/coke then mdma/methylone but of course this does not make this a bad thing, but I could see how you would be disappointed if you were looking for a good empathogen/entactogen experience.</p><p>9:05 still at about to the same level but heart rate seems to be increasing, nothing worrying though. Still not anywhere near as bad as it gets on 4-mmc. Was getting the shakes so I put on extra layer of clothes, now im feeling hot so ill turn on the fan. Its a good equilibrium. Stretching a lot and kinda half yawning while I do so but mostly its moaning in pleasure.</p><p>9:20 well after my last check up my high evolved into one of pacing around the room smoking a bowl getting lost in my mind imaging the future, grand thoughts that will surely seem naive tomorrow. As always its fun though getting lost in the mind. </p><p>9:35 things are still much as they were 15 minutes ago. Still pacing from time to time but not as much. Really all I can say that this is a wonderfully benign but strong stimulant. Real generic, which is what I was hoping for on this particular night. Plus theres been no real drop off, cause serotonin never really came into play. Getting ready to redose though, cause it does feel to be about that time.</p><p>9:45 just redosed 125 mg</p><p>10:35 well after I dosed I watched a few more minutes of Trailer Park Boys, then feeling hot and sweaty I decided to go smoke another bowl outside. I did so and got quite lost in my mind, thought about a lot of overly personal and embarrassing things Ill happily skip for your sake, but over all it was a very serious, very sober almost is the word for how clean this stimulation is, but it does feel great. Definitely not loved up or anything like that, but this drug is perfect for introspective work. Outside it was 60 degrees, lightening and raining and thunder but compared to how hot my body was it felt great. Had a very decent time. Now back inside im going to smoke a bong.</p><p>10:55 been at a very nice continuous level as ive been smoking this bong... im still not through with the bowl but I kinda imagine once im done this high will start pealing back.. maybe not though well see</p><p>11:15 wonderfully introverted state of sober euphoria continues and unabated. I can see why people wouldnt like this if they were wanting a really solid roll, but in terms of positive yet sober introspective thought this takes the cake. Still smoking this bong slowly lol trailer park boys is wonderful</p><p>11:40 you know its still hard to tell if ive come down much, im still very much high. Pretty hot so I have the fan on full blast, chewing gum for the gurning. Still going nicely though. Good fucking times.</p><p>12:35 sorry, I got quite distracted and completely forgot about this report (which always seems to happen by the end).. Ended up masturbating, and it was about as good as it always is for me on good stimulants (amazing!).. coming down but still nicely stimulated.</p><p>Well after the last entry I abandoned the report. After that the very clear, very cherished stream of stimulated conscious that had been pouring from my mind since the roll started receded. Besides that, the come down was a very gradual thing, very gentle, eating food was possible, no nausea or head aches, not over stimulated or uncomfortable, no fiending or moreish feelings. But like mentioned earlier, as with any good stimulant, really the entire 2nd half of the roll was either wanking, or biding my time in between wankings. Was up till about 3:30 (t7:30) and still felt quite high considering I was able to fall asleep quickly and soundly until 8 hours or so later, upon which I woke up feeling great.</p><p>Final Thoughts:</p><p>Although I came into the experience with quite low expectations (but with high hopes nonetheless), I was presently surprised by this chemical. The general low-down on butylone seems to be that it certainly isn't on the same level as methylone or mephedrone, and to an extent I agree with that, however I will often see people go a step farther and insinuate its not even worth doing. I feel like butylone is inferior to methylone or meph in the same way that methylone or meph is inferior to mdma. But if we take each of these chemicals on there own, they can be very pleasant, very rewarding substances (or not, depending on personal tastes and brain chemistrys). For instance there is really no goosed up feelings of universal love, certainly theres nothing in butylone to make you express unconditional love for all of man kind as I so genuinely can on MDMA. However what Butylone offers, which MDMA does not is a very clear mind and some very precise thoughts to go along with the some what forced positive mind set and euphoric energy. Certainly the thoughts thunk on butylone are not nearly as hollow sounding as those on mdma. even days later as I look back on them I still find relevance and truth in what I managed to write down elsewhere. </p><p>So personally, I like this chemical. Not a favorite, but I can definitely see that this chemical has its time and place. I'd avoid if you are one to not like heavy stimulants with little serotonin reward. For me though, the length of this chemical (not long by any means but longer then 4-mmc or bk-mdma), the pleasure of the stimulation, the value of the mind set, the intensity of the experience, and the lowish dose have earned butylone a place in my heart.</p>"
