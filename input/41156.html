To start off, I've noticed I am more sensitive to certain drugs than other people. For example, 300mg of dextromethorphan is likely to screw me over COMPLETELY for good few hours, while my friends can function normally on that kind of dosage. So I have to play it safe and stay with lower dosages than other people.<br><br>
Me and some of my friends had gone to the movies one Friday night in January, and I happen to have bought a pack of Benadryl earlier in the day because I had heard about how you can have a nice buzz on it. At about 10:00PM Me and one of my friends get bored, so I go into the bathroom and take one little package, which is 12 pills or half a box. I sit around talking with my friends for about an hour, when it starts to kick in. It wasn't anything major, just little things like something moves in my peripheral vision. Maybe a tree limb would shake even though it wasn't windy, small things like that. My mom comes to pick me up, and I crash in the living room to watch some TV.<br><br>
After about another hour, I feel this intense drowsiness all over me. Not only this, but I couldn't go to sleep because I was beginning to get very restless. Like when you lay down and have to keep moving your legs, except all over my body, so I had to keep moving around and twitching to make it go away. To my dismay the feeling would return seconds later.<br><br>
Then I tried to ignore it, and in the blink of an eye notice my friend sleeping on my couch (I was on the floor). I don't remember him ever going over, and to this day I can't remember if he was actually at my house, but he was asleep so it didn't bother me at the time. Then it started to really kick in. I looked over to my dining room and noticed a grandfather clock. When did we get that? I don't know, and it was gone the next day. I also started to see silhouettes forming in the corners, like someone was there but trying to avoid being seen. These shapes would jump around and then disappear. I also noticed my fridge kept opening and closing in the corner of my eye, and also the microwave too. Another thing is that the room started to change shape a little bit, like it would slowly stretch out to a figure-eight shape, then to a diamond, and back to normal over the course of a few minutes, or what seemed like a few minutes.<br><br>
I eventually was able to go to sleep around 2AM, after fighting with the full-body restlessness once again. The next day I felt completely fine, no hangover or anything. Maybe a little dulled thinking and sluggishness, but not enough to stop me from going skateboarding.<br><br>
Flash forward three weeks. One night I lie down to go to sleep around 10PM, and after a few seconds I hear a slipping sound in my room like a sleeping bag falling off of the back of a chair or something. I open my eyes to a blurred form of my room, with the shape changing in a few seconds like when I was high on the diphenhydramine. My shirt I had put out to wear the next day was flapping around like a flag. I also noticed gigantic spiders crawling on my ceiling, which upon closer inspection turned out to be two air vents and a light fixture.<br><br>
That was the first of what I think are probably flashbacks. It is now March 2005, almost two months later, and the little flashbacks happen about once or twice a week, always when I lay down to sleep. I think the darkness may have something to do with triggering them. It's lessened over time, and I can usually tell that what is happening is not real and just close my eyes and go to sleep, but sometimes it's damn scary. The last Monday of February 2005 I can remember what sounded like shuffling feet in my hallway, and even a humanlike moaning, and I just about had a heart attack from hearing all this.<br><br>
I hope this stuff stops soon.<!-- End Body -->
