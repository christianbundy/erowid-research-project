 "report": "<p>I was doing my senior paper on Daniel Pinchbeck, DMT, and global consciousness. The only psychoactives I had tried prior to this were Ketamine, MDMA and LSD. I talked to a guy that I had only been in contact with for maybe a month. He sold me the ketamine, and MDMA. I asked him about DMT because I was doing a paper on it and was just plain interested. He told me he could get it and that he could walk my best friend and I through the experience. </p><p>But first, he wanted us to try something else. He called it the 'salvia trick.' For a day we were put on a strict diet that lacked caffiene, dairy, red meat, and large amounts of sugar. Somewhere in the evening he gave us huge capsules of MAOI's that we took. An hour we drove to his house and were already seeing trails and feeling quite happy in general. His room was very plain with only pale green on the walls and a few black and white pictures of smiling impoverished people. </p><p>He had us take whiffs of frankincense and cedar wood extracts to calm us down. By this point, I hadnt smoked a cigarette in a few hours and was craving one. He reluctantly handed me an all-natural no additive cigarette. I took one hit of this and as I exhaled I felt and saw a ripple pulsating out of my body. He talked for a while and I stared at a picture that had a man standing. I saw this picture moving with a ferris wheel in the background and a rollercoaster cart slowly being reeled up towards me. When the time was right he handed me the salvia. </p><p>I took one hit and did not pass out but my mind was already clouded with its affects. My friends said so uhh.you gonna take another hit. I picked up the bowl again and took another hit.</p><p>I remember a huge net made of people holding on to each others limbs diagonally. I was part of this but the person supposed to hold on to my lower left ankle could not get a hold of it. The people suddenly were all wearing sweaters and jeans and one of these people was a lady who said something incredibly annoying and whatever she said had an insane amount of audible dissonance. Her phrase repeating very quickly and all I could see was a windmill of colors that did not match and I had the notion I would never escape this place and be swept up in this aesthetic dissonance forever. </p><p>My eyes opened to the room and saw my dealer sitting in a lotus position. I swear he was saying the sky is falling, over and over and just smiling. I looked at the walls and the room was fleeting through somewhere at a very fast pace. I got up and walked across the room. He got my attention before I ran into his closet and I turned around. He said something along the lines of is it over? </p><p>I thought it was and tried to walk to the couch and then fell flat on my ass just as the guy said maybe not.  I saw that the walls were constructed of the people connected in that net and thought that the guy had set me up for a bad trip. For an instant, I hated his guts. I stood up and grabbed a bottle of water and tried to drink it. I ended up getting some in my mouth and substantially more on my clothes. I sat down and passed back out. I do not remember my trip after this but I passed in and out of consciousness for 50 minutes tripping my nuts off. </p><p>Looking back, this part of the trip must have been rather hilarious to watch. My friend told me I was passing out every minute or so and all the while I was trying to add in pleasantries as my dealer was talking very fast. I only remember waking up again and again and saying uh huh, or nodding my head to make sure he didnt think I was ignoring him. I hit a joint that he had rolled during my trip but afterwards lacked the energy to finish it. By the way, I drove straight home to my mom after this and left my friend in my passenger's seat, slipping in and out of consciousness until his girlfriend came and took him home. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>It was disturbing beyond belief for that small amount of time and the paranoia remained for about a day. Now, I am just interested in what the whole experience meant. It was so random that the only way I can sum it up is to say I experienced a very annoying, random, infinity. But I am very much still interested in pleasant infinities that can be reached through such means.</p>"
