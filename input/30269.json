 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI went to a local health food store and found a large jar containing lots of the stuff.. It was 16.99/pound, and so I grabbed a bag and proceeded to fill it up.  I ended up with what looked like around half an ounce - quite a bit.  Anyways, it ended up costing fifty cents.. so far I'm loving it just for the price. Also, the stuff seemed pretty fresh. I don't know if thats been part of the problem for other people who have tried it and havent felt anything.\r\nThe stuff looks *quite* a bit like weed, only its all broken up - like the shake at the bottom of a bag of weed, and its also got a few long stems. I tried chewing on a little bit of it and it tasted pretty flowerish and sweet.  There is no real distinct smell to it.\r\nAnyways, I got home and packed a very large bowl in a handpipe and proceeded to smoke it. The smoke was very harsh and it was hard to hold it in my lungs for very long, but I managed to get through the bowl just fine. After even the second hit I could start to feel a heady buzz coming on - VERY much like the onset of a marijuana high.  By the end of the bowl my body was feeling distinctly different.  Its hard to explain - but I just felt relaxed all over - and this was without a doubt caused by the damiana, it was *way* too noticeable to be a placebo effect.\r\nMost of all, my head was feeling quite buzzed. Not like being high, but very tingly and relaxed. I sat down at my computer and listened to some music, and it definitly sounded better than it typically does, very enjoyable and smooth.  \r\nI then proceeded to go downstairs to make a cup of tea with the stuff - I mixed some chamonmile in with a little over a teaspoon of damiana.  The tea tasted pretty good, and I drank it pretty quickly.  I could feel the effects intensify as I got towards the end of the tea. Just to be clear though - the effects of this drug were definitly noticed, and it felt good, but it was nowhere close to being high at all, rather just a very mild head buzz that was enjoyable.\r\nAfter downing the tea I went downstairs and chatted with my mom for a bit.  I had no problems whatsoever interacting with her and I felt fine the whole time.  I also noticed after looking in a mirror that my eyes looked normal - no redness or anything.\r\nAll in all, it was an enjoyable experience and I plan on giving it a try again sometime soon.  I was a bit dismayed to notice that pretty much all of the noticeable effects of the drug were gone whenever I would start moving around or walking.. they were only felt when I was sitting in one place not doing any significant movement. But if I decide to get into smoking this stuff on a semi frequent basis, I'm definitly going to need a water bong - the smoke is too harsh otherwise.\n\n\n"
