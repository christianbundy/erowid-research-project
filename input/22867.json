 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI started taking Adderall when I was a junior in high school.  I had always excelled in school; usually at the top of my class in test scores and overall grades and performance since the 2nd grade.  I'm not bragging, the point is that I probably didn't need the drug to begin with.<br>Nevertheless, I first tried the little blue/orange pill when a friend gave me some to help me study.  It was incredible.  The difference in my level of concentration was unbelievable.  I persuaded my mom to take me to a shrink who gave me a prescription, easy as that.  For my entire junior and senior year in high school I would take the prescribed dose, 10mg twice a day, and would always find where my mom hid the stuff and take another at night before studying.<br>Simply put, it sent me into another world so to speak where I would delve into my studies, writing papers that teachers couldn't believe I wrote and propelling me towards graduation with a 4.5GPA, ranked tenth in a class of 300 plus people.  I never got much good sleep during that time and I could tell that the drug was wearing on my body, but I didn't really care because the benefits seemed to outweigh the costs.<br>I eventually started taking at least 10mg before I did anything, especially sports.  I played baseball ever since I can remember and Adderall gave me an edge.  I put me into a zone where I simply didn't make mistakes.  I'm now a junior in college at UNC-Chapel Hill and Adderall has taken over.  I played a year on the varsity baseball team but screwed myself up so bad with the drug. I got so nervous on the field that I couldn't just let myself play like I used to do.<br>My grades are no longer as good as they used to be.  I take so much Adderall before studying that my mind gets flooded with so many thoughts that impair my ability to even write a paper.  I take it all the time sometimes staying up for up to 3 days at a time, then crashing for a day and missing class and everything else of any importance.<br>I started using cocaine my sophomore year in college.  I do it before I go out drinking with friends at the bar.  Recently I went out and did a gram of blow to myself over the course of the night and needless to say couldn't go to sleep the next morning.  So I figured I'd ride it out and go to sleep the next night like I usually do. I took a bunch of Adderall and got on the internet and just killed time.  I got so high that I didn't go to sleep that night or the following night.  I probably took somewhere near 180mg of Adderall over the course of 3 days and nights until something happened to me that never has happened before.<br>It's called amphetamine psychosis and involved hallucinations.  I was in my room when I heard my roomate come in with his girlfriend and go in his room and start fucking like animals.  They were yelling and screaming so loud that I couldn't hear anything else.  I turned my stereo up to drown them out.  This went on for close to 2 hours until my roomate knocked on my door that leads outside.  He had just come in for the night with his girlfriend from outside.  I told them that they needed to fucking keep it down from now on and they honestly had no fucking clue what I was talking about.  <br>Later when my roomate's girlfriend was gone I sat him down and tried to piece together just what the fuck had happened.  He swears to God that they hadn't been in the house until he came in through my door.  I thought I was going fucking crazy.  I honestly hallucinated and imagined the whole fucking thing.  I know you're thinking that they really were fucking and just pulled the wool over my eyes, but my roomate nor his girlfriend give a shit about my hearing them have sex and would've admitted to it if they had been.  The entire episode is fucking bizarre.  I did some research and found out that amphetamines like Adderall can cause hallucinations at high doses where the user hears and sees things and people as if they were actually there.  All I can say is be careful if you're on a upper binge, what you see and hear may be just your fucking imagination.\n\n\n"
