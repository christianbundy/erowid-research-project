 "report": "<p>I started off the night by dissolving a sugar cube soaked in a rather potent mixture of LSD that my friends and I had been enjoying of late. Normally I would take two for a strong trip, like I was after tonight, but I had decided to experiment with mixing other drugs with LSD to change the psychedelic experience.</p><p>This Acid was particularly pleasant as it came on fast. After an hour I was already getting strong visual distortions, the usual warping effects that one experiences while under the influence of LSD. I waited another two hours until I was starting into the peak of the journey, where the visual distortions became full blown, open eye hallucinations, auditory hallucinations and that warped sense of thought that starts to come about. It was now that I decided to take my hit of Ketamine.</p><p>The Ketamine was in a pill, so it may have contained MDMA and other ingredients, but the main compononent was the Ketamine, and it was the K hit we were after. Myself and two of my friends crushed up a pill each and snorted a line. We then rolled a joint and shared it around. Half an hour later I was beginning on the most intense trip that I had ever experienced. First I was hit by an intense feeling of numbness, offset by euphoria, and I could hear strange sounds echoing in the background. I remember looking at one of my friends, who said something to me, but I couldn't make out what was said. Suddenly I forgot how to differentiate between sight, sound, taste, smell and touch. It all became a whirlwhind blur of intense visuals and sounds.</p><p>I remember watching a spot on the wall that seemed to be crumbling inwards, then an intense burst of light exploded from that spot. I watched the light trail and it became a dragon. It twisted and turned, split into two, then rushed towards me. I let out a frightened yelp as I was overcome by the light wave and sat up suddenly. I can't remember lying down, but obviously I had done it  previously. I started to think about that, but quickly lost my train of thought. I could hear something in the distance, something just beyond my reach. I tried to grab at it, but I failed and was only rewarded by a maniacal laugh that sent a shiver running up and down my spine.</p><p>This is when the fear started to hit me. It crept up my spine slowly but surely, my heart started to race, I could hear the blood pumping through my veins... THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, THUMP... suddenly this just became another sound swept up in the whirlwhind of psychedelic colours. I watched as a rainbow myriad of patterns washed over me and I saw in them evil creatures dancing, taunting me and laughing over and over in that horrid, evil laugh. I tried to let out a scream, I wanted to get out of there, I wanted to run, to escape the horrid hell that I had fallen into; when I realised that I had no voice. All things became meaningless, time had lost all relevance, reality no longer existed, all that was and all that there ever would be was my soul, my being, my very existence.</p><p>At this point I got stuck in a loop where I convinced myself I was some kind of deity stuck in a pre-infantile state where I was not fully aware of my awesome powers, and that I could only tap into them slightly through dreaming up my reality. I forgot now that I was on any kind of drugs and as I watched my soul float away from my body, higher and higher into the myriad of colours I started to lose my sense of composure. For lack of a better word, I freaked out because I thought that my soul was being torn from my body and I would have no way to return to my divine essence, doomed forever to obscurity in purgatory. Obviously some other deity was responsible for this, one who knew about my infantile state where I was stuck in a dream, and now that I was awakening they were trying to dispose of me. I tride to scramble my way back to my body, but I realised that as a soul I had no arms or legs.</p><p>At this stage I was yelling and squirming on the floor, and my friends were trying to calm me down, but I still couldn't comprehend them. After a while my soul seemed to return to my body and I started to calm down, focusing on the still shifting, pulsing patterns and entrancing sounds echoing all around me. I have no idea how much time had passed, but I was still tripping intensely, and by the time I could finally comprehend that there were other Human beings in the room with me, it had been nearly nine hours since I had taken the LSD. It still took about another half hour before I could follow conversation sufficiently to respond to my friend's queries, at which point I assured them that I was ok.</p><p>Speaking with my two other friends who had combined the three, I got similar reports. It seems that the dissosciative effect of Ketamine combined with the psychedelics of Acid creates a very, very intense out of body experience that is very difficult to differentiate between reality and the effects of the drug. I have no doubt whatsoever that the sheer intensity of this was due in large to the mixing of Weed with the other two, however. While I would reccommend the experimentation of Ketamine with Acid, combining Cannabis with this as well is a very intense and disturbing experience.</p><p>While I enjoyed myself, and am pleased to have experienced such an intense journey, it is not a combination that I think is meant for Human use. It is very, very easy to panic and have a bad trip on this combination, and were it not for the fact that my friends and I are all experienced trippers who knew how to handle it, I think that things wouldn't have turned out so well. Out of the three of us, I enjoyed it the most, one said it was interesting and the other said he hated every second of the trip. We all agreed it was something that we would never combine again.</p>"
