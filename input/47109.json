 "report": "<p>I just got done smoking a quarter-gram of 5x salvia. It was great. The teacher plant has tried and true. The teacher plant tought me things about its nature today, and about what I can expect since I'm becoming a long-time user of salvia. A salvia veteran. Next time I'm going to order some 20x and that will be nice. I smoked a good bit, like 4 or 5 hits. I was getting higher and higher and higher. Finally I was really high. Finally after my 4 or 5 hit an elephant well, grew.</p><p>It started with the big long snout thingy, then, It grew it's body and everything. It</p><p>was a grey elephant, with red stringy things stuck to it, because there was red hay where we were and it was sticking to the elephant because of sweat. I appeared beside the elephant and began petting it like I had known it all my life, and it was the most important thing to me, and at that time, It was. </p><p>I led the elephant out. There was 2 guys with drums at the exit, and they were pounding the snares loud! And me and the elephant passed by. The elephant got slightly startled, but I pet him to calm him down, and it worked well. Then we went out, following a course on a circus tent, roped off with only thin ropes. The elephant followed this course like a pro, with thousands of intrigued fans watching from above. We made our way down the course, and all along it were band members with brass instruments, obviously the same band as the guys with the drums belonged to- the circus band. The trumpets were loud! Like real life.</p><p>Then I woke up from that experience. I reloaded the pipe and took 2 more hits, A vine grew. A plant came from this vine, a big plant, off-green color like actual salvia itself. It came close to me and began to speak. It had a face, the face of a commander, the face of a god. Flawlessly carved into the petal of this flower. It was beautiful. It began to speak to me with a gentle commanding voice. It spoke so softly yet so dominately. So gracefully yet so masculine. It was beautiful. He spoke to me and told me of the respect I must have for him. That he would teach me if I would go</p><p>into each experience ready and willing to learn, and thoroughly prepared. I quickly </p><p>agreed with him, and then he told me to go take another hit, and smiled. He smiled like a father smiles at his child running into the front doors of the elementary school on the first day of kindergarten.</p><p>I took another hit. I was transported to a good land. A wooded land. Here, things were absolutely gorgeous. A crickets chirp joined with hundreds of others made a music of sorts, The night sky blended with the music sounded beautiful. I know I heard thousands of nature's noises in harmony to create the symphony, but I can't remember what all I heard. I just know that it was the most beautiful chorus ever.</p><p>I was then taken under the ocean, deep in the blue, I was confronted by a tropical exotic multi-colored fish, who quickly swam in front of me and past. Bubbly noises rushed into my ears. Keep in mind im still hearing natures symphony from the wooded lands. They blended together and the symphony became 5x more beautiful. I was in complete bliss.</p><p>I soon awoke. I took another hit or two and was immediately shocked by a large seed that appeared in front of my face. I saw the seed. It was about half as tall as me.</p><p>This seed was the same color as the plant I had talked to, this was the plant's seed.</p><p>I immediately knew. The plant was the keeper of the knowledge I sought, and the seed was the knowledge. I saw it in front of my face, I had just experienced it in natures symphony and the conversation with the plant. I soon woke up from this as well.</p><p>I took another hit or 2, and Vines tangled in front of my face, crossing every which way they eventually embraced me. I was, however, not scared. For I knew these were the vines of the plant. They were protecting me, this was a hug, not a squeeze. I felt the warmth of the plants friendliness all around me, embracing me such as the vines were. Then I heard the voice of the plant, it said, 'Welcome, my child.' This</p><p>was the climax of my experience. Right here.</p><p>Still holding fast to the vines of the plant, I was enlightened. I knew why I had come here, what my purpose was, and it sounded like beautiful music, I heard natures symphony repeat in my mind. It was still with me, and it was still beautiful. The teacher plant had taken me in, I was one with the plant, and the plant loved me, I was it's child, and I was happy to be. We will live happily ever after.</p><p>It's a shame so many people have the opprotunity to experience being an adoptive child of the teacher plant, but yet turn an experience such as this down. They don't welcome the natural effects of the plant, cause thats not how ya be 'cool'. Man, excuse my language,but FUCK being cool. We can do so much more than impress beings upon this earth.</p><p>NOTE: Before this experience I drank a cup of kava tea, and before that I had passed a joint and blunt with some friends.</p>"
