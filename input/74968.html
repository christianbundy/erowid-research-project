Allow me to preface this writing with some background information:<br><br>
I've done a lot of experimentation with various substances over the years.  I learned my limitations as well as the substances I'd never try again.  Methamphetamine is one of the major drugs at the top of that 'never again' category.<br><br>
I recently moved to a college town, and Adderall is very common around here.  As much as I should know about drugs by now; I didn't realize Adderall was an amphetamine - thus, it should have fit the same category as meth.  This was my first (and last) experiment with Adderall.<br><br>
__________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
Last Saturday, a very good friend of mine (Ill refer to him as X) and I were chilling out at my apartment.  We were watching some sports and drinking very heavily (approximately 5:00 P.M.-12:00 A.M.)  After we were both very much intoxicated, X asked me if it was alright if he blew a few lines of Adderall.  Id given him some grief about using it in the past, but I told him I didnt care.  He offered me some, but I refused it.  After hed finished a few pills, he got up and suggested that we hit the club and chase some girls.  I was beyond the point of being able to socialize, so I told him to just go by himself.  I wanted to pass out.<br><br>
As soon as hed left, my roommate arrived with some of his friends.  They wanted to party.  I didnt feel comfortable with people I didnt know being here, so I decided to stay up with them.  I could tell I was embarrassingly drunk, and I didnt want to make an ass of myself in front of new people.  I looked at the plate my friend had used to snort the Adderall, and there was a lot left.  I knew people used Adderall to focus, stay awake, and bring themselves up from a drunken state.  I took the plate to my bathroom, rolled up a dollar bill, and snorted what was left.  It didnt hurt like I expected it to, and there were no immediate effects.  I went back out to the living room to hang out with my roommate and his friends.<br><br>
All of a sudden; I felt awake and clear.  I became more of an extrovert than Id ever been in my life.  Considering all the alcohol consumption that had occurred (and ended minutes prior); I was suddenly totally sober.  After a short while, my roommates friends asked me how much Id had to drink.  I told them how much, then asked, Why, am I making a drunken ass out of myself or something?  One remarked, No, but youre insane!  Id be puking my guts out.  <br><br>
I got paranoid for a second, because I didnt want them to think I was an alcoholic or something but then I didnt care because it might impress them but who cares what they think because Im totally straight and maybe the Adderall didnt do anything and it was just the food Id eaten that sobered me up and why are we watching a Jackie Chan movie and I have to be somewhere tomorrow and maybe life is wonderful.  My mind was racing like this non-stop.  I was composing myself and being very careful to talk sensibly and not stream of consciousness babble.  I hope my state of mind was conveyed here.<br><br>
I had really bad dry mouth, but I wasnt thirsty.  I forced myself to keep drinking some wine in order to try to calm my mind and body down.  By the time they left (about 4:00 A.M.), Id drank enough that I was tired again.  Then, X showed up again.  I could tell he was flying (hed done about 4 or 5 more pills at the club), and I didnt want him to stay there chatting me up for hours on end.  He asked if he could do some more Adderall, and I told him he could only if he gave me some.  We split a pill, and then I snorted some wine to speed up the drip.  <br><br>
We kept drinking as he told me his club story, and at this point time stopped existing.  I have no idea how long we talked.  I had consumed a total of 4 40oz malt liquors, 6 12 oz. beers, and 5 glasses of wine, but I was still awake.  Eventually, I told him I was feeling tired.  He left, and I laid down on my couch.  I dont actually think I went to sleep.  Everything was just black for what could have been five minutes or god knows how long.<br><br>
I shot awake suddenly.  It was as if someone had dumped ice water on my face.  I was extremely alert and my mind was telling me I should get more Adderall.  I had a headache (not the alcohol induced type, either): my nose and face were stinging: my body ached (well, it was actually more flushed and I felt hot): and I wanted more Adderall.<br><br>
It was a Sunday morning (I recall looking at the clock and seeing it was about 10:30 A.M.) and I had to be somewhere in a few hours.  On the way there, I felt so tense.  It was as if I was driving to face the music so to speak, and this is odd because the outing was to a place that is very pleasant.<br><br><font color="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</font><br><br>
I had some pretty random periods of irritability.  I had to force feed myself dinner, and drinking anything (even water) was a chore.  After getting back to my apartment later Sunday night, I hit a psychological wall.  I was so depressed and uneasy.  X called me to ask for a ride to get cigarettes.  When I told him I felt shitty, he offered me Adderall in exchange for the ride.  I didnt want any of it, so he offered to buy me a pack of smokes.<br><br>
After I picked X up, he asked, So, man, isnt Adderall the shit?  I said, No, it is shit, and I havent felt quite this shitty since I tried meth a few years ago.  Its garbage.<br><br>
I couldnt sleep when I got home.  I was wide awake, but at least I was able to drink water without choking it down.  As the hours and minutes ticked away, I got more depressed than Ive ever been in my life.  Id been awake 46 hours or so, and I started getting paranoid.  I called my friends and started giving them these insanely paranoid and bizarre stories.  My friends all suggested the same thing, Calm down, and get some sleep.  Things will be better this afternoon.<br><br>
I skipped all of my responsibilities yesterday to sleep.  It was a deep and dark sleep.  I woke up in the late afternoon and felt a lot better.  I decided to go online and study the drug Id used, and immediately noticed that it contains amphetamine salts.   I was so pissed at myself for trying it without researching it first.  I wont repeat that mistake again.<!-- End Body -->
