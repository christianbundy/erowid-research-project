I bought a vial of this liquid drug called Explosion from the local head shop. It's marketed as a vanilla scented room odorizer and smells of vanilla. The liquid is browny yellow and tastes bitter, but it's not the nastiest thing I've ever tasted and is not too unpleasant to ingest.<br><br>
The first time I tried it I took about 2 capfulls, just get a feel for the drug. I was half expecting an ecstacy type hit, judging from other reports I'd heard, but found it to be much closer to the giggly, wobbly, carefree feeling I get from a mild mushroom trip. My head felt clear, but everything looked and sounded different. Music sounded more open with an extra dimension. I could feel occasional waves of pleasant, tingly warmth washing over me, similar to what I feel on mdma, but sporadic. <br><br>
I felt that I needed to repeat the experience at a higher dose, so a few months later I took the remainder of the vial, which was approximately two thirds of the total content, a couple of hours after a light meal. It's difficult for me to be accurate about the times of events occuring, having written this a few days after the experience, but I will try to remember as best as I can.<br><br>
About an hour after ingestion I began to feel very strange and uneasy, pacing up and down the room, getting waves of hot flushes and paranoia. I found it difficult to get comfortable doing anything and couldn't decide whether to sit in front of a cool fan or put a jumper on to keep warm. Concentration was tricky and attempting to choose suitable music proved to be difficult. I was freaking out a bit, but I tried not to fight the drug, knowing it would end eventually. I tried different kinds of music and found funk to be the most uplifting, positive and often amusing. I was impressed by the auditory hallucinations and music sounded very trippy, but I was still feeling very uneasy and my stomach felt bloated. Some music was almost unbearable. I just kept saying to myself 'this is weird' and 'I'm never taking this again'. This drugs effects are very dependent on mood and surroundings, just like other hallucinogens, such as magic mushrooms or LSD. I would choose music, friends and location wisely if deciding to take this drug. <br><br>
After about 2 hours of pacing through my flat, not knowing what to do with myself, I was getting bored of the hallucinatory effects and feeling like I wanted the whole experience to end. I just wanted to go to sleep, but I doubt it would have been possible due to some of the freaky visuals I got when I closed my eyes (never take this when you're tired). <br><br>
After about 3 hours I started to come down and the experience became much more manageable. I decided to smoke some weed then I put on 'Not Just Knee Deep' by Funkadelic and this was the perfect record to lift my mood. I started dancing in a slightly lazy, giggly manner and the lyrics amused me. I was actually beginning to enjoy myself. Usually, especially when on mdma, I love listening to electronic music, such as Boards of Canada and Multiplex, but with this drug i found it to be a little cold, eerie and emotionless at times, prefering to listen to songs with traditional instruments and lyrics. I listened to 'Ventura Highway', 'Horse With No name' and 'Tin Man' by America and 'Everbody's Talkin at Me' by Harry Nilsson. These songs made me feel very uplifted, alive and free, like being on a deserted, sunny beach. The lyrics are very life affirming and passionate and the production of these songs is amazingly crisp for the time. I was listening to Donovan and he was guiding me through the trip, putting very pleasant, gentle, soothing, amusing suggestions in my mind. I couldn't stop giggling and thinking that he was a psychedelic genius, which was surprising for me as I hadn't listened to much of his music before. That guy understands exactly how to make trippy music.<br><br>
My mind really started working and I started to think about all kinds of things. I felt very clear, happy and focused. If I closed my eyes I could see the most amazing animated sequences of different shapes, patterns and colours twisting, morphing and distorting. Sometimes I could see things like vast palaces made of coloured light that soon shifted into other forms.<br><br>
I was absolutely loving this now and decided that maybe I had just taken a little too much. The sun started to rise and it looked incredibly beautiful. Surfaces were warping. I could see amazing depth and colours in the sky and trees outside. I was seeing coloured speed trails off the birds. It was like a very pleasant mushroom trip and I didn't want it to end. I felt full of love for the good things in life, but this felt more genuine than the feeling I get from mdma. My thoughts were very clear and insightful. I mentally dealt with a few issues that were bothering me in a clear and focused way. I kept laughing to myself and wishing that music sounded this good all the time. I didn't want to go to sleep now, because I was having such fun, but I thought I might need to go to work the next day, so I went to bed. Sleeping was sporadic and I kept having to get up to urinate, but I got a fairly decent rest. Woke up feeling slightly fuzzy the next day, but not unpleasantly so.<br><br>
I can't understand why people compare this to mdma, when it's much closer to hallucinogens like mushrooms and LSD. This drug did not make me want to dance in the same way that mdma does. Mostly I just felt like sitting on my sofa and letting gentle, trippy music wash over me. When I did choose to dance it was in a sloppy, careless manner, but it felt amusingly pleasant. Sometimes I would get locked into a groove and start throwing shapes, but it didn't feel charged up like an mdma induced dance and dancing didn't greatly enhance the experience. I haven't experienced any noticeable after effects from this drug, such as flashbacks or depression.<br><br>
I think I would take this drug again, but maybe at a lower dose (half a vial) with some good friends on a sunny day, somewhere we can see trees and sky, with a pre-prepared selection of appropriate music. It can be extremely pleasant, but it can also knock you sideways if you're not careful, so treat it with respect.<!-- End Body -->
