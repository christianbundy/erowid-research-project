 "report": "<p>\nWow I dont really know if you could call that tripping but whatever. I was sitting around bored so I figured id try a threshhold dose of DXM just to get a feel of it. I know I didnt use only the pure kind but it was all i had available. I took a bunch of calculated cup fulls and threw em down. Two hours passed and I though nothin was happening, when then all of a sudden i started feeling a bit nauseus and disoriented. Next thing I knew I woke up on my bed hot as hell feeling sick 3 hours later. I only have breif rememberences of those 3 hours but most of it is gone. And now about 20 minutes after i woke up i feel preety out of it. I wont be touching that shit again. Definitely not worth it.</p>"
