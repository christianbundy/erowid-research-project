It was my freshman year of college.  I had already been smoking pot for over a year, and I had tried 2ci and coke before.  Me and my friends got together one day and decided to all do shrooms.  All but one of us had done them before, and so we decided to do only a half eighth each.  They were double capped shrooms, and supposivly really potent.  We ate them straight up, and mixed some of it with water, to get some of the powder down.  After consumption, our friend that had done it before suggested that we smoked some pot.  So we did, and we all smoked.  We stayed inside out dorm room the entire time.  I began to feel the effects after only 15 minutes.  <br><br>
After about an hour, I was beginning to hallucinate.  At this point in time, I had already smoked about 6-8 bowls of pot, thinking that everyone there was smoking, but I was unaware that I had smoked about twice as much as everyone else.  I was beginning to see some light patterns, and changing colors, but nothing too extreme.  I was also laughing somewhat weirdly, not really out of control, but almost in a creepy manner.  I felt almost embarrassed of the way I was laughing.  At some point in time (I dont really remember), I changed my seat to a chair in the middle of the room.  I dont really remember much of what happend when I was sitting there.  Anyway, my friends all decided to go outside, but when they told me to come with them, I was too scared to go.  I just wanted to stay inside, and calm down.  But they all wanted me to go outside with them.  <br><br>
When my best friend grabbed my hand to pull me outside with them, I had a seizure (so I am told, I dont remember it happening).  All I knew at the the time is I was sitting in the chair, not wanting to leave, and then the next second I was on the floor.  When I opened my eyes on the floor, everybody there (about 6 people) were all just freaking out.  I couldnt even really make sense of what was going on.  I felt as if I was in a different world, watching a tv that was the view of my own eyes.  It was a very weird feeling.  It was like this for about 5 or so minutes (I think) and I was just asking people what was going on, and what had happened.  Then, I all of a sudden felt much better, but knew that something was not right.  So I stood up and started demanding if there was a sober person, that I needed a sober person to come and help.  In my mind, a sober person was the savior, someone who knew what was happening, almost a doctor.  My neck was stiff, and I felt really tired, and I decided it would be best for me just to lay down in my bed and calm down.  When I laid in bed, I looked at the ceiling and was having some minor hallucinations.  I made everyone leave the room, except for my best friend (who was also on shrooms at the time, but I forgot that fact, and I beleived he was sober).  I just wanted the trip to end, and I was feeling really sick.  I just closed my eyes and went to sleep.<br><br>
About a half hour later, I woke up.  When I woke up, I didnt have any idea where I was, what was going on, or even who I was.  I would look at my clock, and see the time, but not be able to know what it meant.  My friend was in there waiting for me, and I would ask him questions repeatedly, such as 'what time is it', 'where am I', 'what happened', and 'am I dying'.  I think he was answering, but I didnt hear him, or if I did, I didnt understand what he meant.  I really felt as if I was dead, or that I was going to die.  My entire life was just going through my head so fast, but I couldnt recognize any of it.  I had completely forgot of the prior events.  I felt I was in a different dimension.  I knew everything beforehand, such as that we were going to take the shrooms, but I didnt remember taking them.  I would ask if we had taken them, how long ago, etc, but when I got the answers, I couldnt comprehend them.  Im not sure how long this time period lasted, and I dont really remember the details but it felt like hours.  At some point, I fell asleep again.  When I woke up, (approximatly 3 hours after taking the shrooms) I was completely sober, and I remembered the entire nights experiences.  The entire trip, as I said was about 3 hours, but had felt like almost an entire day. <br><br>
I met up with my friends a bit later, and they were still somewhat tripping.  They werent really hallucinating, but rather they were on the comedown.  What they described to me was the exact same feeling I had when I was on 2ci.  I walked around with them for a good deal of time, and was pretty much quiet the entire time.  I couldnt stop thinking about the night, it was probly the scariest experience of my life.  After a while, I didnt really feel hungry, but I felt like it would be good to eat.  So I went and got some tacos with 2 of my friends that had tripped with me.  I finished it, and it felt good to get something into my stomach.  We ended up talking about what we all thought had happened to me earlier that night, and one of my friends came up with the conclusion that I had a panic attack.  He began describing the symptoms of a panic attack, and I felt as if I was going to throw up.  I got really hot and sweaty instantly, and I got up to go to the bathroom.  I was about half way there, and then the next second, I was on the floor.  I didnt remember, falling or anything, and when I opened my eyes, I felt fine, and didnt really have to throw up anymore.  I just felt really embarassed, and I knew something was wrong.  My friend went and got his car, and drove me back to the dorm, and I went straight to bed, and passed out. When I woke up the next day, I felt fine.  I decided that I would never do any drug like that again. <br><br>
I decided that I would never do shrooms again, but that coke and pot and drinking werent really an issue.  But one night when I was smoking pot, I had smoked quite a bit (after not smoking for about a week).  At least a gram of pot.  I was sitting in my chair listening to music, and I began to get the feeling as if I was going to have another seizure.  The music was overwhelming and there were way to many people in the room.  So I turned off the music, and told everyone to leave, and I closed my eyes to try to calm down.  When I opened them, I was completely blind, but then slowly I started to get my vision back, and everything looked like a dark, fuzzy tv.  Once everyone left, I went into bed and just calmed down for a while.  When I got up the first time, I went to the bathroom, but still wasnt feeling good, so I went back to my bed.  I got up a little bit later, and I was fine, and I wasnt high anymore.  <br><br>
I tried smoking a few times after that, but no more than a hit each time, if even that.  And everytime I smoke, regardless of how much, I begin to get that feeling of the other night.  I cant say whether its the drugs, or its something in my mind (possibly anxiety), but I decided it was best not to smoke, or do any drugs, again.<!-- End Body -->
