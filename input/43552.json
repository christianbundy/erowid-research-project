 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI was given Adderall prescription to help with my ADD.  It was wonderful, like coming out of a life long fog.  I was able to experience emotions, communicate, think clearly, be organize, sense of well being [lost weight! yeh] but it has one side effect for me that negates almost all of the positive ones.  Starting at 30 mg and higher, my scalp starts to itch.  I drives me crazy.  Unfortunately, the medication helps me to focus on the itching.  My doctor was no help in solving this problem.  I have relentless searched the internet without finding a solution.  I have already tried antihistamines and they does not work, from Benedryl to Zrytec.\n\n\n"
