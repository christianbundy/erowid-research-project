It was a wed. Night, I had just gotten over a virus of some sort, and was perscribed tylenol with codine to suppress my cough, and help me sleep.  Some how my friends convinced me to go out, I figured I'd take a tylenol with codine... And I'd be okay and out of any discomfort from my cough or what not.  I also decided that I wouldn't drink a lot.  I ended up having 3 beers (which isn't a lot), in about an hour... I was feeling a buzz, but didn't want to drink any more b/c I had taken the pain killer. <br><br>
Pretty soon my two friends and I wanted to head over to a fraternity house, where we regularly smoke weed.  I was feeling really good in the car, and decided that the perfect end to the night would be smoking some weed, and going to bed.  When we all got up to our friend Brian's room, I was anxious to smoke some and go to bed.  My best friend took the hit before me, and she took a really good big long hit... The guys were clapping. So of course I had to do better if not match her bong hit.  We would always see who could take a bigger hit, and clear it completely.  I usually don't smoke out of bongs because I had a bad high the first time I smoked out of one.  However, it had been a few years, and I had recently smoked out of the bong... Which was Brian's and it was about 2 ft high.  I knew I had taken a really big hit, b/c I couldn't stop coughing, and a few mins after my face began to get flushed.  I know I'm going to get really high when my face gets flushed.  Then it happened, like all the other times I got paranoid when smoking weed.  <br><br>
I looked down at my hands, and they didn't seem to be a part of my body, and It felt like I had just woken up from a dream.  I knew I was going to be 'scary' high, and started to dwell on this fact, which didn't help me at all.  Every now and then I'd look up and feel like I had just awoken from a dream, and everything that had just happened... Seemed like it was forever ago.  I looked at Sue, and told her that I needed to go home now.  I kept saying it.  All I wanted to do was go home and have some sense of self.  Then I looked at Michelle and said the same thing, I think they both thought I was crazy.  Sue asked me if I needed to go to the bathroom. I said yes, and went with her.  I couldn't even see myself in the mirror.  Sue asked if I needed to throw up, and I said yes... So I started to make myself throw up for no apparent reason.  I kept telling her 'I am in this world, but I'm not... And I can see myself through a little hole'. I can't exactly explain this feeling, and it usually happens a little when I'm really high, but this was out of control.  <br><br>
I started to remind myself about how I got there, and started thinking about everything that happened in the past hours that lead me to the frat where I was throwing up.  My perception of my own self was messed up.  I didn't feel like the same person, I didn't feel that I looked how I normally looked, etc... I couldn't even tell you where I was from until I really thought about it.  Sue realized that I needed to go home, and I was getting deeper into my paranoia state.  <br><br>
The next thing I knew, I was walking outside on my way home clutching Sue's arm.  I kept telling her my heels were sinking, and they were... Into the mud.  I also felt as if I were slanted sideways.  And somewhere along the way, I peed my pants, and that is the first time i've ever peed my pants while messed up from drugs... (I only smoke weed and drink alcohol) anyway the whole walk home seemed like it took hours, while it only lasted about 10 mins.  When I got to my dorm, I went straight to my other best friend Steph's room. I soon realized that I needed to actually finish peeing... Sorry thats gross but, I went to the bathroom and peed, and then came back and sat on steph's floor.  I woke up her roommate and demanded a gatorade.  She gave me one, and they took a picture of me out of control laughing on the floor spilling it everywhere.  I looked at the trash can, and made a face and said... I don't feel so well.  I felt nauseated all of a sudden. This part gets a little graphic and gross, sorry... So Steph and Sue quickly ran me to the bathroom, I sat and puked for 2 hours, straight... Still high as hell... In fact I was basically dry heaving, because I hadn't had anything in my stomach.  <br><br>
I was so sick, I threw up every 3-10 mins, and I couldn't comprehend anything that was going on around me. I wouldn't let anyone touch me b/c I felt so sick, in fact I couldn't even put water in my mouth because it made me start to convulse.  After 2 and a half hours in the bathroom, one of the girls wanted to call the medics, Steph and Sue being my loyal friends came and gave me a pep talk, about how I did not want to get caught by the police, and and that I need to pull myself together and if necessary puke in the trash can in their dorm room.  They had to literally pick me up off the floor, and carry me.  I layed down on her floor and totally passed out, I woke up a few hours later and sat straight up realizing the nights events and said 'what the fuck' loudly, I think I was still a little high.  I was weak the next day, and was pretty embarassed.  I still smoke weed, and drink, however I don't recommend mixing the two with a pain killer. I guess thats what the problem was, because I've drank and smoked together a lot more, and it was never like it was.  It scared the hell out of me, and it was the worst night of my life.<!-- End Body -->
