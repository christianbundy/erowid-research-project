 "report": "<p>Years and years ago I used to smoke pot on a daily basis.  For various reasons, the last time I had any was about 9 years ago.  I heard about JWH-018 somewhere online and did some 'real' research on the substance and decided to try some Spice, which I easily obtained from a head shop in town.</p><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from it, but considering what I had read online, it seemed to be legit as far as providing an experience similar to pot... so my expectations finally settled on getting stoned.  I tell you what -- it got me Stoned, with a large capital S!  I'm sure it's because I haven't had any pot for about 9 years or so, but good god man... it didn't take much at all, and the stuff got me extremely high.</p><p>I didn't smoke very much from the gram I bought.  I didn't weigh it, so there's no point in claiming validity of the measurement, but I would estimate that I used about 1/6 of the gram.  I loaded the pinch in a small water bong, lit it up and took a nice, big hit.  I held it in for about 15 seconds or so and took another hit.  After I let the second hit out, I noticed the stuff still smoking a bit so I took one last hit and cleared everything out of the bong.</p><p>It wasn't long at all (I would say 1-2 minutes) before I was heading down the familiar path.  It always seems to start in my head and work its way down my body, eventually embracing me wholly.  I immediately began to think, 'holy shit, this stuff is getting me stoned!'  I had initially dumped all the spice from the package out on the top of my laptop, so after I had finished with the pinch I loaded in the bong, I started putting it back in the package.  I knew I wouldn't be having any more of it.</p><p>As soon as I sealed the package shut, I realized how stoned I was getting.  At this point, we're only talking about 4-5 minutes from having the last hit.  I was getting so stoned that I started freaking out, like I used to do sometimes when I got super stoned from smoking pot, so I got up and emptied the bong water, cleaned the bowl, etc, and decided I needed to head to the bathroom to possibly throw up.  As soon as I got in there, I emptied the rest of the Spice into the toilet water, flushed it, then tore up the bag into small pieces and flushed that too (major paranoia).  I dry heaved a couple of times and then ended up sitting on the toilet for about 15 minutes with my head in my hands, sweating intensely and having a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I couldn't believe how stoned I was!  It was VERY familiar, yet just a bit different (95% familiar, 5% different).</p><p>After sitting on the toilet for those 15 minutes, I decided I'd end up passing out or falling asleep if I stayed there any longer, so I got up and made my way into the couch in the living room where I laid down and cracked open my laptop.  I needed something to focus on, because I was getting very paranoid about the experience.  I kept telling myself that I only smoked a little bit and it was just because I hadn't been stoned in 9 years or so... but my paranoia always gets the better hand.  So anyhow, I'm laying on the couch and thought that writing whatever came across my mind would help to calm me... I needed something to focus on and the following text is the result of this excursion:</p><p>'The thought of doing this is what's keeping me sane right now.  I often times frequent drug websites to read and to imagine.  Some worlds seem so far away from me that it's as if they're non-existent, but this world is a familiar one, which is how I knew I'd make it.</p><p>So I feel I have to write about this before I split apart.  I feel like I may lose myself before long.  This comes in the midst of the storm for my soul.  Thunderous waves crash upon the shores, a warning of much worse things to come.  Mighty beings are emerging from long forgotten prisons outside the normal wavelength of the human mind. I am lost among the flames which are constantly leaping toward my chin, </p><p>Ok why has this turned into that?  I just wanted to sit here and type some stuff as it crosses my mind.  I always freak out about it and I need to remember that.  This has turned nasty on me.  It's definitely got me by the balls and is nowhere close to thinking about letting me go.'</p><p>I finished writing that and ended up sitting here for a bit, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, in a state of confusion and paranoia.  Thoughts were becoming very audible and chatty... kind of like a song in the sense that it was designed in a certain way and was meant to be observed, but existed of chatter and conversation between me and myself, and I wasn't controlling the thoughts.  I just sat there listening to it and decided I was way too paranoid to submit the experience.</p><p>I closed my laptop, focusing on the TV instead.  Everything at that point began to undertake a negative connotation and I was frantically in search for something positive and less evil.  I got up, got some water and came back to the couch, trying to settle my mind down with the fact that I could do all that in a controlled manner.  I told myself everything was OK and it would be over soon, but it just didn't seem like it would ever end.  It seemed like I was fucked and that was that.  It felt like I was losing myself, and it may have been the end.  My paranoia owned me.</p><p>Finally I cracked my laptop back open and opened my clock so I could time my heartrate, which averaged 116 beats per minute, which I figured wasn't too bad.  I went back and forth between breathing deeply and slowly and timing my heartrate again for about a half hour.  Deciding I was OK but still needing something to focus on, I started doing a typing test online which I averaged 85wpm, even with 100% accuracy.  That really helped settle me down!</p><p>Eventually I called my wife. She's out of town for the week, just left today and I already miss her.  All throughout the experience, I couldn't stop thinking about her and thinking about how fucked up it would be if I had a heart attack over this stupid, stupid thing I had done tonight.  I kept telling myself that I HAD to come back for her.  There was no way I could let myself get lost.  The phone conversation with her was surprisingly coherent and really helped calm me down and make me happy.  I'm a pretty lucky guy having her in my life.</p><p>Anywho, it's about 3 hours after having had those hits and I've come back down nicely.  My head is finally clear now and my body is rather relaxed, and I feel fine.  Feels just like coming down from being stoned from pot.  My experience was most likely affected by having been a stoner years back and not having smoked in so long, but wow... just wow.  This stuff got me so stoned and I wasn't even sure I'd make it back.  It seemed to come on very fast and VERY hard and kept a grip on me for a good couple of hours.  Overall a very paranoid experience, but a good one in the sense that I now know there is something out there, currently legal, that'll get me stoned should I care to partake again.</p>"
