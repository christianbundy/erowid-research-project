I had read about the psychoactive effects of Dimenhydrinate and remembered feeling kinda fucked up when I took 3 Dramamine (50mg) a few months before on a long car trip.  <br><br>
I went out and got some generic dramamine and downed 5 at about midnight.  I had been high all day and taken 10mg of Valium so I was already feeling pretty sedated.  About 35 minutes or so later my head became very heavy and I felt my depth perception was exaggerating.  Then I snorted 5mg of Ritalin which stopped the body buzz.  I was sitting in front of the computer in a dorm room with several people in it but I felt like everyone was  miles away and the room had the volume turned down.  About 2 hours into it I took 3 more because I had stopped feeling the body buzz (probably due to the ritalin).  About 20 minutes after that I suddenly felt like I was in a completely foreign place, nothing made sense and I couldn't remeber things that had happened seconds before.  So I decided to head home.<br><br>
Out in the empty halls however at 4:00am on a Monday things got really interesting.  I stepped into the hall and I felt like I was 2 feet tall.  Next thing I remember I am at home talking to my friend  and I  remember saying 'walking is hard right now' and then suddenly I'm in bed.  I know I'm not asleep but as soon as I close my eyes I'm driving my car and my friend is talking to me.  I cough and suddenly its my room again the door opens and in comes that same friend and he says 'wassup man' and I responded with something like 'what the fuck are you doing here' then I snapped out of it and realized that it wasn't happening and it was just my room.  I finally fall asleep at about 5:30am.<br><br>
Its now 12:30 pm Monday. I woke up and I felt like shit, complete worthless shit.  I felt like shit all day and didn't eat much.  My body still felt heavy.  I decided maybe I'll give it another try so I go get some more and take 6 on an empty stomach with some Pepsi.  15 minutes later I felt a buzz and got laughy.  I drove to a friend's and it all stopped, I didn't feel anything.  <br><br>
Half an hour passed and I felt like I had no ability to remember anything.  I would start a sentence and then stop because I forgot what words I had just said.  We smoked a joint and I got back in the car to drive a friend home. I started feeling like time was moving extremely slow and I kept checking my speed (I felt i could have gotten out and walked at 70mph). I drop my friend off and go back out to another friends house who was tripping balls off of DXM.  <br><br><font color="yellow">[Erowid Note: It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible to drive while under the influence of a psychoactive substance. Don't Do It!]</font><br><br>
We both took a 5 foot bong hit and sat down.  All hell broke loose.  I felt my heart rate it was down to like 40 beats per minute and if I wasn't moving part of my body I couldn't feel it.  My friends head melted off his body in the strobe light his arms became part of the wall and all I could see of him was his eyes which looked like holes in the wall.  I layed down and felt like I was standing up everything was flashing in and out of existance and nothing seemed real it was like I was remembering it. I got the sudden fear that I was going to die which quickly faded when i did a head stand in the middle of the room and it still felt like I was standing right side up.  <br><br>
Then I got very sedated and things (including what I could see of my arms and legs) in my side vision were floating around and I was  convinced that I had come out of my body and was nothing but air that could speak.  So I said fuck it and took another one with a NoDoz as soon as I did it I started seeing starts and I felt like I was going to black out. Suddenly that last pill didn't seem like a good idea and all I could think of was that I had OD'd because I had forgoten about how many I had the night before. So I puked my guts out and once I started I couldn't stop and I even burst some blood vessels in my eyes and eyelids.  The body buzz went away after that and the effects started to subside.  I got just a couple more visuals and drove home feeling how strange going back to normal felt like.  I went home and tried to remember what I had just done but it was really hard so I went to sleep.<br><br>
Next time, I'll keep track of how much I do.<!-- End Body -->
