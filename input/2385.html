* June 4, 1989 - Beijing, China: Many students are killed by government<br>
  troops while protesting for democratic reforms in Tiananmen Square.<br><br>
* June 4, 1989 - Washington, DC suburbs: Through a a series of<br>
  coincidences, I ran across a little square of white blotter paper<br>
  containing a sample of Hofmann's magical elixir, and so have my first<br>
  trip.<br><br>
* June 4, 1999 - Beijing, China: Soldiers raised the Chinese flag over <br>
  Tiananmen Square in Beijing, as China tried to ignore the anniversary of<br>
  the student democracy movement there a decade ago. <br><br>
* June 4, 1999 - Washington, DC suburbs: Unlike in China, June 4 is an<br>
  anniversary full of joy for me, and one which I celebrated quite fully<br>
  this year, as is fitting for 10 years...<br><br>
        Ahh yes... my 10th rebirthday! This is one that I won't soon<br>
forget. I hadn't had LSD in a pretty long time... about 15 months since my<br>
last mild experience, and around 2 years since my last full blown LSD<br>
experience, which had been a little on the rough side. I've been exploring<br>
other entheogens quite thoroughly in this time, but I stayed away from LSD<br>
for a variety of reasons.<br><br>
        With my 10th rebirthday approaching, however, I decided it was<br>
time for a reunion. I obtained a hit of green geltab acid, and set it<br>
aside for the upcoming anniversary.<br><br>
        June 4th finally came, and I felt that old familiar nervous<br>
anticipation rising in me. Acid! My first and most familiar ally... I<br>
found myself incredibly nervous, which struck me as silly. I've done this<br>
countless times. I've done crazy shit like ayahuasca. Why is a little hit<br>
of acid causing so much tension? I guessed just because it had been so<br>
long. I decided on 11PM for take-off.<br><br>
        Around 10:15, I decided to go on my regular internet chatroom to<br>
relax and smoke some cannabis before take-off. I go on there and find one<br>
person taking AMT, one person taking DPT, one person taking AMT with<br>
mushrooms, one taking DPT with ketamine, someone else taking LSD, and a<br>
few other assorted trippers. Surprise, it looks like the universe decided<br>
to throw me a spontaneous rebirthday virtual-party! Well, alright then!<br><br>
        I placed the sacrament at the foot of my Buddha carving, and lit a<br>
stick of incense. I reflected upon all that I had been through with LSD<br>
over the last 10 years, and all the wonderful things I have learned from<br>
it. 11PM, down the hatch! Well, like I said 10 years ago, theres no<br>
turning back now!<br><br>
        I felt a strong alert by 11:15PM, and knew I was going to be in<br>
for a wild ride. I was also overcome by a strong wave of nostalgia about<br>
LSD. I put on headphones and listened to Moody Blues, broke out a folder<br>
of my old LSD-influenced drawings, and began reminiscing. I read old LSD<br>
reports of mine (unfortunately, I've only made a few of them). I thought<br>
about how different of a world it was when I first fell through the rabbit<br>
hole. There was still a Soviet Union. The Internet was still not much more<br>
beyond the wet dreams of a few visionary geeks. Someone reminded me that<br>
the Tiananmen Square massacre happened the same day. 10 years. Wow...<br><br>
        Around 12:15, I wasn't tripping unusually hard, I was at a Plus 2<br>
on the Shulgin scale. I started to get worried that I wouldn't trip any<br>
harder. By 12:30-12:45, however, I realized that I was about to trip quite<br>
a bit harder. I went to lay down just as I found myself hurled into an<br>
amazing Plus 4. I remembered how much I loved LSD right then, and wondered<br>
why I had let it go so long.<br><br>
        The peak was spectacular. I was laying in bed in a dark room, the<br>
best way to experience acid I think, and the closed-eye visuals were<br>
mindblowing. At the same time, I felt that high-speed LSD consciousness<br>
train blasting through my skull. The visuals and thoughts were very much<br>
in sync. I thought about many things... how much I had missed acid, how<br>
much I had learned from it over the years... and then into reflections on<br>
my life. Realization that this was my first acid trip as a non-smoker,<br>
which struck me as being an important milestone. After a little while, I<br>
stopped thinking *about* anything and I became just a process of<br>
abstract thinking, accompanied by the fantastic acid visualscapes of the<br>
disembodied eye state. I experienced strange temporal distortions, had<br>
visions of the LSD 'spirit' appearing to me as a yound woman dressed in<br>
white muslin, saw both the dark and the light sides of acid as a sort of<br>
'This Is Your Life' nostalgia session. I had a particularly amusing vision<br>
of people putting tabs of acid to their tongues and immediately sprouting<br>
wings from their mouths and flying off to the 'real' world (a la 'The<br>
Matrix', sort of).<br><br>
        Sometime during the height of the peak, around 1-1:30AM I would<br>
estimate, I had a very strange experience. I had the sensation that I was<br>
somehow communicating with an entity - which I soon realized was Becky.<br>
This had a strange feeling of being real... some sort of telepathic link.<br>
I found myself talking to her soundlessly in some sort of impossible<br>
space, and rapidly became confused as to which one of us was who. 'Whats<br>
happening?' I felt her think... and I thought back 'I don't know, I just<br>
think our realities are overlapping...we'll just have to ride it out.' I<br>
felt a strong feeling of caring, and soon after, it was as if we zoomed<br>
apart at hundreds of miles per hour and the contact was broken. The<br>
strange thing is that the next morning when I spoke with her, she asked<br>
'So, did you feel us talking about you last night?'<br><br>
        Around 3-3:30AM, things leveled off enough that I was able to move<br>
around. I returned to the internet chatroom, and soon someone convinced me<br>
to try a little ketamine, saying that the combination was amazing. I cut<br>
some out into two large lines, returned to my bedroom, snorted the<br>
ketamine, and lay down. I waited. I got a strange visual effect where<br>
everything began to 'melt' somewhat - the effect is similar to what would<br>
happen if you sprayed water on a watercolor painting. This only lasted a<br>
short while. I felt a mild increase in the trip's 'weirdness' factor, but<br>
overall it seemed to make no real big difference to the character of the<br>
trip - I think I was already too far out for it to have any effect. I<br>
wasn't very disappointed, not being very fond of ketamine to begin with. <br><br>
        I got back on the chatroom and had a great time talking about<br>
tripping with everyone for a while. Around 5AM, I decided to take a little<br>
bit of DPT to boost myself back up a little. It added a little vibrational<br>
signature to the trip, and brought back some intensity, but didn't add a<br>
whole lot to the trip, as I only did a small quantity (25mg at most).<br><br>
        2 or 3 hours later I got an email from some guy in Serbia who had<br>
emailed us a few times before. It was a picture of a peace sign overlaid<br>
on a potleaf. I decided to go to CNN's web s ite and saw a headline saying<br>
the war in Kosovo could be over by the end of the weekend. I made a<br>
little prayer for peace.<br><br>
        Around 7AM, I had dropped down to a level where I was mainly<br>
stimulated, more than tripping, and decided it was time to take a little<br>
GHB to make myself sleepy. No such luck! I ended up consuming enough GHB<br>
to tranquilize a herd of elephants over the next 6 hours, and barely<br>
noticed any effect over the lingering LSD stimulation. I finally managed<br>
to fall into a fitful sleep around 1PM, sleeping until 6, when I woke up<br>
physically drained but mentally full of energy.<br><br>
        This was one amazing trip, totally worthy of a 10-year anniversary<br>
celebration! And it was a spectacular reunion with an old, trusted friend.<br>
I won't be letting it go that long again before I schedule another date<br>
with my beloved Lady Sidney the Divine...<!-- End Body -->
