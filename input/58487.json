 "report": "<p>I've been a daily pot smoker for a few years now. I'm also experienced with tobacco (I was never a regular smoker though) and have recently been tripping on shrooms on a regular basis (a few times a week, taking tolerance into account). I'm experienced with salvia and benzodiazepines. I am currently not taking any medication or supplement, and only have a Cannabis and psilocybin cubensis mushroom tolerance. </p><p>I've never really considered using alcohol because 1) I don't consider it an entheogen and 2) I was a born Muslim, and while my family isn't very religious, my friends are, and most do not drink or do drugs. I don't consider marijuana against Islam, and I myself have never been religious. I am agnostic and spiritual but I do not believe in an organized religion. When I turned 21 I started buying alcohol for my friends who were still under-age. Today I was bored, cleaning up the house and about to smoke a joint when I stumbled across some alcohol from a few months back. </p><p>I felt a little regret because morally I am not into 'fuck me up' drugs like alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. I've always been into the hallucinogens. The bottles had to go though, and I was not going to let this alcohol go to waste. My morals sat aside while down went a bottle of Heineken. This was chased by the remainder of a 750ml bottle of Bacardi (bottle says 40 proof alcohol by volume. It was around 1/2 a cup). The Heineken tasted awful but the harder stuff wasn't so bad. It tasted like the smell of isopropyl alcohol. </p><p>I had not eaten in a few hours, and less than a minute after downing the stuff my stomach felt warm. I started getting excited but at the same time I was a bit nervous that the dose wouldn't have much of an affect. After about 15-30 mins, I noticed that I was a lot more relaxed (I normally have lots of anxiety) and was in an overall better mood. I also had to piss, but held it in for a while because I just felt good being sitting on the computer, and I'm a big boy and can hold it in. It wasn't bothering me too much. </p><p>I finally stood up to go pee and noticed that my coordination was a bit off. If I concentrated I could balance myself on one foot for longer than 10 seconds, but I couldn't hold the pose forever. I pissed and then walked around my house, giggling and admiring the effects of this drug. I am still under the influence as I type this. This is similar to the benzos, but this is more euphoric. The benzos just make me emotionally numb and drowsy. </p><p>I can definitely see the psychological addictive potential of alcohol. What Marijuana does to me is it really enhances my sense of hearing and taste, and greatly increases my creativity. I don't consider pot an intoxicant. Alcohol puts me in a great mood and I smile and laugh for no apparent reason. My typing is slow and I can't spell worth shit, but thankfully Firefox 2.0 has a built in spell checker. Anyway, normally I am depressed and my mind is stuck dwelling on the past. Dwelling on what I should of, or could of done. At this moment, however, I feel like my mind is Here Now. </p><p>Music doesn't sound as good as it does while I'm high but I find interest in music I'm sick of when sober. Emotionally, I feel great. My negative feelings and anxiety have been abolished and I feel like doing something. Anything. I am somewhat bored. On pot I feel satisfied alone, but right now I am thinking about a girl I've recently taken a fancy to. It's more sensual than sexual. I have a few major problems going on in my life right now, but trying to think about them now just gives me an 'It's OK' response. Alcohol seems like a great way to escape life's problems, and I can see why some of my friends love the stuff. </p><p>Overall, I find alcohol great to relax and unwind, and I can see why it's a great social/party drug. I do plan on trying a heavier dose in the future, but I will likely not use it anytime soon unless I am at a party or anywhere it is readily available.</p>"
