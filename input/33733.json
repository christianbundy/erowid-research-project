 "report": "<p>I tried dilaudid for the first time with my fiance, who had obtained the drug from a friend, calling it 'dalotta'. I had never heard of it, but my fiance said it was similar to a heroin high. We crushed up the 2 mg pills, and snorted them. I instantly felt a warmth flowing through my head. It worked quickly, and had no unpleasant burn. (I usually have my fiance blow first, to inform me of the burn factor.)</p><p>I sat at my computer, and the words just seemed to type themselves, I had so much to say all of a sudden. About 15 minutes later, I began to feel a burst of energy. It was such a different feeling than what I had been experiencing not much earlier. I felt an overwhelming sense of euphoria and love for all things on earth, and I guessed that this must be what heroin is like. No wonder it's so easy to get addicted. I know it sounds bad to say that I am doing this as a mother, but my children were safely in bed before I even thought about taking the pills. However, I wanted so badly just to wake them up and cuddle them. I just wanted to hug everyone. Intermittent urges to just get up and hug my fiance were irresistible. I wanted to float away. Then about half an hour later came the calming feeling again, and I stretched out on my couch. </p><p>I relaxed for about fifteen minutes, and suddenly felt the need to sleep. I couldn't keep my eyes open, like my lids were made of lead. I couldn't even PHYSICALLY pry them open. So we bumped another 4mil. I instantly felt that surge of warmth again, and wanted to dance around. I felt strong. I felt invincible. I felt like none of my thoughts were stupid, and everything I said was so insightful. We talked about music, television, gameshows, people, work, EVERYTHING. I don't even know anything about politics, and all of a sudden, we were debating about presidential nominees and their platforms. About 45 minutes later, I got the tiredness again. It was nearing 11:00 pm, and the tired was taking over me. My eyelids were heavy as before, and I decided it was time for me to go to bed. However, when I stood up, I felt sick. I felt like I had to vomit. But I couldn't. So I went to bed. FIVE MINUTES LATER, I was wide awake. I must have layed down and got up about twenty times, before finally settling in bed. </p><p>The next day, I woke up sick. I threw up once, and didn't feel better. But that would be the last of the vomiting. All day, I felt lethargic and tired and sick. I napped it off, and thought about what had been happening to my body. It wasn't an experience I regret, it just wasn't as predictable. Having taken all things into consideration, I would definitely do it again.</p>"
