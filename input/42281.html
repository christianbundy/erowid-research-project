I'm in my early 20s and have used both oxycontin and cocaine before, but never really liked either of them very much, and never used both of them at the same time.  My favorite drug still is and always will be marijuana, which I am addicted to and smoke every day.  However recently I was offered both a 20 mg OC pill for $5 and .3 grams of some highly pure cocaine for $20.  The smell of the cocaine was incredible, you could even smell it in the air when it was inside my pocket.  Well I don't like to do opiates or cocaine very often but I figured hey, I'm only going to live once, why not go for the speedball effect from sniffing the two drugs.<br><br>
I had a good day set out for it, I was planning on chilling and getting fucked up for the better part of the day and then going to a concert that night.  I planned to sniff the cocaine and OC throughout the afternoon and then throw the rest of the cocaine I had left over into a blunt to smoke before the concert.  I started with cocaine that day at about 2:00PM sniffing about 1/4 of the .3 grams.  I felt a nice buzz afterwards and my whole face and parts of my jaw felt numb, and I sat around watching TV.  The cocaine made me feel pretty nice but at the same time kind of paranoid which I didn't like and never will.<br><br>
At about 3:00 the cocaine had well worn off and I was ready to do some OC.  I started with a line that was app. 7.5 mg of the pill and after this my paranoia went away.  I felt great lying on the couch and sinking into it, feeling very lethargic but also very alert.  I didn't want to move around much but I was alert enough to be able to talk to anyone.<br><br>
After laying down and watching tv for another hour I started to feel really lethargic so I decided I needed a little pick me up.  At app. 4:00 PM I sniffed another 1/4 from the bag of cocaine.  This gave me more energy but it was nervous energy and I stood around walking in circles not knowing what to do with myself, feeling anxious and paranoid.  Again my face was numb and I felt buzzed but I didn't feel relaxed like I had after the line of OC.  After the cocaine buzz had settled I started to feel more settled, as well as very euphoric.  In fact it was the most euphoria I had felt all day and I just layed down once again enjoying it.  <br><br>
However, this enjoyment didn't last long and soon I felt like I wanted more oxycontin because the waves had started to settle down.  I sniffed another 7.5 mg of oxycontin at 5:00 and ordered some food because I hadn't eaten anything since 12:00 and I wanted to have food in my stomach while I was on these drugs.  Once I started feeling the oxycontin again all paranoia went away and I felt very euphoric although slightly lethargic.  I ate the food and noted that I wasn't nauseous which was good.  I have had a few bad experiences in the past taking too much oxy at once and feeling nauseous but fortunately it didn't happen this time.  After dinner it was about 5:45, I was feeling great and layed down once again to watch TV and wait for my friends who were coming at 6:30 to pick me up for the concert.  I decided at this point that I didn't want anymore oxycontin for the night so I left the remaining 5 mg at home.<br><br>
However, I kept the rest of the cocaine with me because I was still planning on putting the rest of it into a blunt to smoke before the show.  My friends came at 6:30, picked me up, and we got there at about 7:00, at which point we rolled the blunt and put the rest of the cocaine in.  Then we took a walk in the woods because the area around the concert was all wooded, and I smoked the blunt with one of my friends; our other friend never hit it because they were our designated driver.  Well we had only smoked about half the blunt when my friend and I were both too fucked up to smoke the rest of it so we decided to save it for after the concert.  At this point I felt a huge rush to my head but I was still able to walk and talk fine and function normally, just rediculously high.  <br><br>
We walked into the concert at about 7:30 and sat there until it was over at 11:00.  I felt great the entire time, I just sat in my seat and grooved to the music very euphoric and seeing trails.  After we left and my friend and I's designated driver (and friend) drove us to my house, we smoked the rest of the blunt.  After this blunt my high reached its climax for the day, I felt a huge rush to my head and a bit dizzy.  My friend and I went to our separate rooms to sleep and I layed down for about an hour hallucinating and feeling very euphoric.  All in all it was a very euphoric experience but I definitely prefer marijuana over both cocaine and OC.  The OC made me feel too lethargic and the cocaine made me feel too paranoid.  All in all it was a memorable experience but I probably won't repeat it again, partly because I like opiates more than cocaine, but also partly because I prefer marijuana over both of them.<!-- End Body -->
