 "report": "<p>Having never really tripped before since acid is unavailable where I live, decided to purchase 500mg of 5-Meo-Amt online and give it a try.  I did as much research online as I could, however there was very little information available at the time.</p><p>The small bottle arrived.  I do not own a scale and ones capable of measuring amounts in the mg range are fairly expensive so I took a risk and estimated a dose of about 2 mg by halving the pile over and over again.  This method is described as very dangerous method and I agree.  The difference between a 2 mg pile and a 4 mg pile and an 8 mg is very small, and when 4 mg is twice the dosage you are planning on taking, boy you better hold on to your seat.  Any how, I snorted the small line and felt mild effects similar to those after the peak of an ecstasy peak.  This lasted for about an hour or so and then went away.  Later on I tried a larger dose, with the same effects.</p><p>The next weekend, me and my friend decided to try the drug together, and I eyeballed the amount (again, a very dangerous and dumb thing to do) luckily, I must have a good eye.  We watched tv for about 30 minutes and werent feeling much other then extreme cold because it was winter and my cottage didnt have heat.  So, we decided to drive to my house to hang out... I lived about 20 minutes away from my cottage.  We packed up and I began driving.  After about 5 minutes of driving, putting us about 35 minutes after dosing, my friend tells me to stop the car, he needs to puke. I stop and m thinking the worst.  He got out and began dry heaving when I opened my door and began to puke. I had not eaten for about 6 hours so I was done puking quickly. My friend was not so lucky and had just come from a big dinner.  After we gathered ourselves, we continued to drive.  I felt mild physical and mental effects.  My friend however, was seeing people in the woods staring at us, he was pretty freaked out, but was able to cope.</p><p>We finally got home.  The visuals grew stronger, he was still seeing people outside in the woods, I was only seeing patterns and swirling, which were pretty cool.  My mind was coming up with some really strange thoughts and I began seeing people popping out of reality as if the world was projected onto a movie screen and then they would disappear... Very cool.  The night went on and the effects slowly wore off. We didnt get any sleep jus laid there watching the patterns.  The next day I felt better then normal and slept like a baby that night.</p><p>Since then, I have done it 3 more times.  Each time I do it, the effects are a lot stronger and kick in a lot faster.  My most recent dose was possibly a bit smaller then usual.  It kicked with visuals and physical feelings after 15 minutes.  I spent the next 30 minutes in the bathroom.  After my stomach settled, I tripped harder then I ever had before from about 7:30 pm until about 10am the next morning.  I was seeing people in the room, I thought I was in like a music video, every room of the house had a different feel, floors were swirling walls were moving, it was incredible.</p><p>My opinion of this drug is that it is very potent and shouldnt not be fooled around with.  Know your dosage, start of small and work your way up.  If you have 500 mg, u have a lot to waste! Do it on an empty stomach. Try to have a small lunch and skip supper.  You will most likely puke, but it will be short and sweet.  The trip will last about 12 hours, and will peak at about 4 or 5 hours... It just keeps going.  I would describe the trip as a mix between more mushrooms than I have ever done w/ a bit of ecstasy.  Once you dose on this drug, you are in for the long hall, I suggest being in an environment with one or two friends, and you definitely do not want to have to deal with parents or any other authority on this.... Its almost impossible to keep a train of thought... It can be scary, it can be amazing, there's no telling how you will react. Be careful.</p>"
