 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nFirst of all, I'll assume the reader is aware of the incredible synergy between psychadelics and nitrous oxide. If not, they might want to refer to other trip reports. I have tried nitrous in conjunction with mushrooms, 5-MeO-DiPT (foxy), and even four-day hallucination-inducing sleep deprivation - each experience itself is unique but the overal character of the experience seems to be correlated to the particular psychedelic being used.\r\nSo this report is for a particular morning when I woke up, and, quite unlike me, I decided to try some of the 5-MeO-DMT I had lying around ALONE and take a nitrous hit during the peak. I've done this combo before, but I was with two friends and I wasn't able to fully immerse myself in the experience. Now I think I understand it better. So I eyeballed about five milligrams of 5-MeO-DMT into the glass pipe (NOTE: This is pure stupidity. I am very familiar with this batch of 5-MeO-DMT so I was able to do this approximate measurement without too high a risk of overdoing it - read some of the reports of people who have taken too much 5-MeO-DMT alone to see what could have happened) and took a hit, being careful to monitor the smoke intake, held it for a few seconds, and let it out. The effect came on almost instantly, the room became bright and sparkly and my consciousness began to fragment itself into colored crystals. This is typical for a low-level 5-MeO-DMT experience for me. I was still completely in my head though - I didn't want it to be too strong since I was alone and still needed to take the balloon filled with nitrous I had prepared for myself.\r\nI gave the 5-MeO-DMT a few more seconds to settle in, just to be sure it wasn't going to be too intense. Once I was sure I had peaked, I took the nitrous in one breath, and held it. I was lying in bed at the time, and now I closed my eyes and covered my head with blankets so I was in total darkness.\r\nDarkness is key.\r\nWhat happened is hard to describe, but it was one of the most beautiful things I have ever experienced. Although I could still feel the blankets around me, and I could still hear music perfectly clearly (later, when I repeated this with my iPod on), all my senses except sight were completely normal. But what I was seeing ... it was a some sort of unimaginable fractal universe that was controlled entirely by my sensation of touch. Moving my arms through the blankets, turning my head, running my fingernail down my back - these all produced vivid and intense changes to the structure of the fractal universe that I was seeing, or rather, enraptured in, while at the same time the sensations these movements produced affected my body completely normally. The feeling of being 'wrapped up in a billion warm blankets' by the universe or perhaps 'swimming in an infinte warm ocean' made it more real than if it had been merely a visual hallucination. Still, I could feel around me and understand exactly where the blankets and pillows were (and earlier when I had done this with my friends I could feel her arm and her hand). \r\nI remember a universe of white skeletal structures, a universe of multicolored irregularly-shaped bubbles with glowing silhouettes and others I don't remember. Each was dead-calm and silent and no fear was involved whatsoever, just a sense of peace and unimaginable beauty, similar to my several serenely-beautiful mushrooms + nitrous experiences but very unlike my terrifying but brief foxy + nitrous experience. I could tell that I was breathing quite slow and hard during the peak, and I purposefully breathed into my pillow to muffle the sound. I was also mumbling 'oh my God oh my God' over and over. Unfortunately, as short-acting as 5-MeO-DMT is, nitrous is even shorter-acting and within a minute or two the experience was over and all I had was residual 5-MeO-DMT effects for a few more minutes aftewards.\r\nIn summary, I'd say that this is DEFINITELY worth repeating. I'm sure I will do it again, perhaps with different friends this time, perhaps with a slightly higher dose of 5-MeO-DMT, perhaps with MDMA as well. I've never had a bad experience with 5-MeO-DMT by itself (e.g. I've never puked, never felt the 'chemical terror') - then again, I've never taken more than about 7-8mg smoked, and probably less than that considering that it's hard to get 100% of the vapor into my lungs. But however powerful the 5-MeO-DMT experience is, combining it with nitrous will probably make it QUITE a bit more powerful. I could definitely go further with this, but I have a lot of experience with different psychadelics and I know and trust my body. \r\nComplete darkness is key. It's entirely a CEV-experience, the OEV's are't important and in fact if I have ymy eyes open I will most likely not experience the beautiful touch-controlled universes. The moment I opened my eyes and moved the blanket off my head, the trip was over. I was still having psychadelic effects, but they were so slight I was able to easily throw on some clothes, walk downstairs, and grab a bite to eat.\r\nAs a final note, I'm not even sure if I necessarily need to keep my eyes shut to experience the synergy between psychedelics and nitrous (naturally I tend to close my eyes, and perhaps it's just coincidence that the experience ends when I open them?) but I would definitely recommend trying it this way.\n\n\n"
