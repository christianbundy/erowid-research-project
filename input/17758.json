 "report": "<p>It was thursday night and I had arrived in Pheonix, Arizona a few hours earlier. I had traveled there by a bus to stay with some friends for a while, I will call them Mr. E and Mr. R.  I was fairly energetic when I arrived, which is suprising because I took Ecstacy the night before, and usually I am exhausted the next day. The bus ride was incredibly long and boring, so I did catch up on sleep on the way over.</p><p>At about 10:30 pm, Mr. E and Mr. R introduced me to one of their friends, I will call him Mr. J, and he took us to a nearby drug house.  I brought 50$ with me, and when we arrived there, I went to meet the dealers with my 2 friends.  Mr. R stayed behind in the car.  When we got inside, I asked the two guys if they knew where to get any weed.  They said they were out for the night, so I asked if they knew where to get any meth.  One of the dealers took Mr. J into the back room for a minute, then they both came back out.  One of the dealers asked me and Mr. E if we were 'the police'.  I guess they were suspicious we might be undercover cops.  Mr. J, who knew the dealers well, convinced them we weren't cops, and they sold us 30$ worth of crystal.  I still had some more money and I asked if they had any acid, they said no, but they asked me if I wanted to buy some 'Sherm'(PCP).  I had never tried it before, and I had wanted to, so I said sure. They sold me a fully dipped cigarette for 20$.  Mr. E, Mr. J, and I smoked a couple bowls of crystal out of a meth bong with the dealers, and we took off to another friends house.</p><p>When we arrived, we split the crystal between the 4 of us, me and Mr. E getting the largest lines, and we chilled and talked for a while.  Then Mr. E picked up the PCP cigarette and asked if I wanted to smoke it right then.  I said ok, and we lit it up.  The taste was awful, and we all took 3 fairly big hits each.  For some reason, I assumed I wasn't gonna feel much of the PCP, or that it might be some bunk chemical.  I was wrong.  In a matter of minutes, all 4 of us were like 'Whoa'.  Mr. E, Mr. R, and I were all new to PCP.  Mr. J had tried it before.</p><p>When the PCP kicked in, I felt my crystal high and my PCP high, both very strongly.  I was extremely talkative, yet dizzy, and I felt like going outside and picking a fight.  I felt invincible.  My vision started to get very weird, so I decided to experiment.  I walked into a poorly lit hallway, and stared at my reflection in a mirror that was hanging on the bathroom door.  My eyes started to lose focus, and in the mirror I looked like I was melting. I adjusted my eyes and I was back to normal.  For the rest of the night I was wide awake, and for most of the night I was having long and thoughtful conversations with both Mr. E and Mr. R.  I felt so euphoric, I loved it.  I also noticed when I tried to shut my eyes to go to sleep at about 4 am, the CEVs were so bright and clear, I just sat there and watched them like a cartoon.</p><p>Eventually my stomach began to feel extremely sick, and I puked 4 different times.  I feel sick to my stomach as I am writing this, it is about 7:40 am, but I am still in a good mood.</p>"
