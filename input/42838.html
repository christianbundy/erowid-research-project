I have times stated during this report, they are approximate my phone become unreadable about the time I made a saftey call.<br><br>
I started the trip with a friend we had 150mg of 2C-T-2 'Squid love'. We both choose to rail some, I was wanting a stong trip and inhaled about 40mg over the next 3 mins, he had about 18mg.<br><br>
We then left the party about 10pm deciding that tripping alone and walking back to his house would be fine, it was.<br><br>
T+ 5-10 mins: We just turned the corner I remarked that I wasn'tt feeling anything too heavy just yet, thou the burn from Squid was amazing, not the most painful substance to rail but definantly wins if you think about for how long the pain can stick around.<br><br>
I start feeling a tightness in my stomach, and my friend yaks. We joke about his weak stomach for a sec and notice first audio effects, the powerlines are crackling. He says yeh nopticed it on my last trip, little weird eh? Asked if that's going to follow us the whole way home, shrug and a laugh we keep walking.<br><br>
T+ 15 mins: The sides of my vison are now blurry, shadows flickering, nothign to strong but it definantly effecting me, take a few more steps and have to yak, stare at the ground for a good 15 seconds amazed the grass and sand is writhing beneath me.<br>
Pull myself up and set off to catch up, chatting about what we are seeing, both decide that it's a sinister drug - sneaking up on the corner of your vision, shadows change, noise is distant, hollow almost. Our bodys are being work over right now, head feels detached from neck, because of  blurr it feels like I'm bobbing alon at about 6ft high, my body however isn't have the best time. So more yakking and noticed clenches almost when I tried to relax, it made walking an experiance, adding a fast-slow sway back and forth while heading forwards almost like walking and having a seizure.<br><br>
T+30 mins: I had now had well and truly enough of this experiance, with 45 mins left to I walk sat down and called a  friend back at the party, mate who was with me said not too use a saftey line so lightly, I said that I really didn't feel capable of walking the rest of the way, we had drunk all the water (god that help settle the stomach after some yakking) and we were exceptionally thirsty, with no taps near-by, and a glowing coke maching and no change! Friend answers, I explain where we are ask if he'd come pick me up, say he really can't have a fair bit to drink and would be over the limit, damn. But the stopping and distracting myself helped more than a yes could have. With new resolve and a seemingly better grasp on things we set off again.<br><br>
T+35mins-1:20 : Wow, we ranted and raved the whoule way back to his house, just about what I can't remember, but ego loss, paranoia (a huge dose for me) and revenge for acts showing basic lack of respect for a human were involved. Visuals and now very intense and body effects have not become worse so I guess that makes them better. Halting outside my friend house I ask if anyone in there had had 2C-T-2 before, no he says. I demand are you sure, yes. We talk a little bit about this and then head in, that was that paranoia before, we were both in a state I didn't want to invade someones home with this 'evil' all very cute and scary but somehow through all of this a I was still having alot of fun.<br><br>
T+1:30, Walk in explain that were tripping, what on etc. get berated a bit for taking dangerous drugs, we haed off and have a bucket, the weed sets a nice gloy to things start feeling relaxed, never thought about the paranoia again, psyche and sense of place were still all over the place thou. I sit down and watch a movie the lcd screen is warping and colours are irridesent, nothing is staying still, and the closer I look the more it's moving, seeing in fractles was the best term we had for it. I finally work out the film is 'Half Baked' plot line is impossible to understand and i wander back to the kitchen, friend comments that the trip is like film editing, laugh, yeh trying to make sense of a whole when you can only focus in little bits.<br><br>
T+2:30, another (very drunk) friend comes back home, I then suggest we take the remaining Squid I have left, about, 65mg. The drunk friend and myself take the battle lines, we go back downstairs smoke a few more buckets and and feeling good but ravaged, i sit on the couch and wander between bedrooms till morning, at one point sitting witht the drunk frien we agree that the trip was amazing, I lost any real grasp that I'd have 2 and 3x as much as my friends.<br><br>
The visuals over this period were intense and when i closed my eyes it was a void of something that wasn't quite light, ideas of things could rush at me out of this void, all very weird never experianced a reality like this on and other substance.<br>
The floorboard made out of bleeding jarrah did in fact bleed and I preferred not to look at them, evil could still come out of the shadows.<br><br>
T+ Dawn: Feeling a changed man I put on my sunglasses and walk out of my friends house, visuals and still strong, body is physicaly exhausted. On my walking home I have to remover the sunglasses because of the contrast of light blurry vision and dark hallucination vision.<br><br>
When I get home I take a shower I can feel the heat of the water but not the actual showering itself, the shower screens still moving and I can't make sense of the world around me, physical co-ordinate is worse than at the end of a 5 day weekend , no sleep. decide to sit down play on my computer and listen to music, I soo become absorbed in looking at images on my computer, pass a few more hours with the extra colours and warmth from my vision and pass out.<br><br>
*Noted*<br>
On 2C-T-2 trips since negetive effects haven't noticable in strength, even with insufflated dose bordering on 30mg.<br><br>
After tripping on Squid-love, I've wanted to take ecstacy less and have noted that even when i do the experiance feels suppressed, I think this is all mental, but it could be a lasting side effect.<br><br>
I feel that on this first trip I had far too much or the substance, I was removed for my ego and my psyche, the empathy and communicating with people while feeling like a different person, humaitarian emotions intensified. It was a ++++ trip but I do feel desestised to my trips of anykind now, when you come close to killing yourself and love every second...<br><br>
I feel the urge to take 2C-T-2 now, I'd say it's addictive mentally, a few of my friends agree, altough not a powerful addiction it's wispering in your ear remind one that it's never not a choice, you want to try it again. I'd say thou the drug is an accquierd taste, it borders so close on an unpleasent experiance.<!-- End Body -->
