 "report": "\n\n\n\n\nI had always wanted to seek answers via the mushroom.  Sure I had done them many times before, but I always got this nagging feeling that I was not truely expereinceing them. I was just relaxing with friends, and having a good trip with others.  While I'd be on trips, I'd always think 'Imagine this by yourself, find your path, and walk it'.  So on my 24th birthday, I decided to do just that.\r\nI told my friends, some of who thought I was nutso for wanting to trip alone in nature, and others who looked at me in a new light, seeing I wanted to grow as a human.  So we drove out to a beach/island.  I smoked a blunt with my friends who liked marijunana.  Then we injested some shrooms.  I took the largest portion about 1/8th maybe.  When I started to feel it come on, I asked my friends to leave me now, and that I would return hom sometime tomarrow.  At this point I was here in reality on a beach with my friends.  \r\nThen they left.  I realized I was -alone- for once.  I was utterly alone, on an island away from everything, though I could get back to the city pretty easily.  Everything vanished, I was transported out of this dimension.  In the nightsky horizon I could no longer see buildings and city off in the distance.  I saw mystical things, castles, and other planets.  It was as though I was on an Island in the universe, and I could see everything around me.  I was no longer physical, I was completely in my spirit realm.  \r\nI climbed a hill, and looked around at everything. I looked down at my watch, to see if time existed here. But mayan/aztec/ancient symbols flashed on it every second, changing. I didnt understand these symbols, but thats when I realize fully, I was completely somewhere else.  I walked down from the hill and went to the one opposite. I looked around here, something didn't feel right.\r\nI was looking for something afterall, I came for the answers, to expereince this, what was I looking for... THE PATH. I look down the hill and see a path in the dirt.  I walk to the path and it is a fork. I hear a question in myself outside of myself, not really sure where, but the question 'Human or Not'.  I say 'not' and begin walking down one of the paths almost automatically.  Strange.  I come to various forks in the road, in which I am asked questions, I answer, and begin walking down the path that represents that.\r\nNow for some quick background on me.  I don't consider myself 'male' or 'female', I also have very androgynous features as a person, and have lived my life part as a male and part as a female.  At the time of this trip, I had begin moving towards my true self, of androgyny.  But this trip set it in stone.  At one path, I am asked the question 'male or female'.  I felt as though this would decide the rest of my human life, so I should sit and think about it.  I sat there, and began to laugh at myself 'What a silly thing to think about, this is a trick question, the answer is neither'.  \r\nAs soon as I had that, I stood up and walked down the third fork which I didn't even see before.  Walking along, I could hear the mushrooms spirits talking to me about life and spirituality.  Things I can't even write here, because I'm not sure how to write them.  Finnaly I say 'I want to see you'.  Everything gets quiet, and still.  Nothing is there.  I guess I wanted the spirits to materialize and show themselves to me. At the time I didn't get the fact that THEY WERE SHOWING THEMSELVES TO ME.\r\nThey are everything.  Nature is there, everything has a spirit and conscience.  Thats what the quiet was showing me.  I thought to myself 'There must be more, show me more'.  So I just started walking, walking, walking.  Oddly I saw people.  Apparently I was not alone on this island.  These people looked at me discontently, and ignored me.  I walked more and more.\r\nNext I was standing at what I call the 'trip crossroad'.  I get this everytime I shroom now.  I can choose to go totally insane, and have a nightmare trip, or I can choose the 'light path'.  What I was given a choice was this.  I was standing by the water, and I realized the spirits were 'water'.  I realized all were spirits, everything nature was true.  To the other side of me was a white trailer.  In which three little identical bald men were typeing away on the computer.  As I walked around this van, I knew they were monitoring me.  I could feel as though everything was as scam computer program. My life, everything.\r\nI realized, this is my paranoid delusional mind.  My dark troubles, my fears, the falsehoods, lies.  And the 'water/nature' was the truth.  I could control which universe I lived in.  The dark lies and deception, my darker demonic side.  I admit, I have praticed many forms of  spirituality, and I had spent alot of time focusing on negative-energy.  The point of this mushroom trip was to find positive energy.  A lighter side to myself, because I tend to be a dark person.\r\nMost dark people don't want to come into the light, for some reason I wanted to try both.  I had already had this 'darker' trip before long ago.  I decided it was time for truth, to experience nature, to feel light.  I walked away from the white trailer, and I could almost feel my darker side of insanity go 'Awwww, please come back.' as though I was letting part of myself die.  However I know what happens following the darker path in life, I've been there, and experienced enough of it.  This trip was to be my step into light.\r\nBy the water, I felt at one with everything.  I was water, the water was me.  The spirits of everything were all around.  I decided to keep walking down the shoreline.  I walked and walked and walked, no signs of reality existed anymore, just fog all around me.  I suddenly stopped, and felt beautiful.  I knew this was 'my heaven'.\r\nThere were some funny strange birds from another reality playing in the water.. These are 'my birds' I thought.  They symbolize part of me.  I laid on the sand, and slept.  I awoke several times, each time feeling in peace.  My spirit realm was eternally night time.  The stars in the sky were always beaitufl. All was good and calm.  I knew 'I can stay here forever'.  The spirits reassured me, that If I wanted to stay, I would not have to go back to the horridly boring reality everyone faces. I could remain at 'one' with everything forever.\r\nThis sounded great, but then the spirits asked 'but have you done everything you need to do?'.  And I knew the answer was no.  The spirits told me 'You can come back and visit anytime you seek answers, or direction, you do not need to stay'.  I knew I should not stay, there were people to influence in my life.  I had 'good' to do in the world, that I had yet to do.  So I got up and took 'the road to reality'.  Strangly enough it was a dirt road, that stood out from the fog.  Nothing around it.  I walked for what seemed like days, occasionally sleeping along side this road.  In my mind, time did not exist, in this realm, time has no concept.  Finnaly I started seeing bits of reality show up.  A trashcan here, a sign there, etc.\r\nThen I hopped over this fence, which I knew was the fence separating realities.  Suddenly I was back on the island I started on.  I saw my car and walked up to it, it looked like it was speeding down the highway as I walked up to it.  When I touched the door handle, I saw myself inside the car getting into a car wreak! I let go of the handle immediatly and I was standing next to the car still.  I heard 'there are things to do before you go, you will be safe if you do them'.  Then I realized I needed to clean up my area where I started.\r\nSurprisingly I found this spot easily, and there was my blanket and various other things.  I picked everything up.  I heard the spirits say 'leave us'. and I knew it meant the remaining part of my shrooms.  So I said a prayer and offered them to the earth.  I buried them on what I call 'the veil between realilities'.  I knew if someone ever finds them, they were meant to find them, because of where they are hidden. Inbetween worlds, on the line.\r\nI put everything in my car, and sat down in it. I heard 'what time do you want to return?'  I thought 4am sounds like a good time.  So I put my fingers on 12 and 4 on my clock.  Suddenly the hands started spinning around and around and around until the clock said 4am.  Then BOOM, everything ended, I was shot back into my body and mind completely.  Everything was as if I had not takin shrooms.  The only thing that existed was an afterglow and a 'knowing' feeling very spiritual and happy.\r\nBut the spirits left, and I heard 'You will be safe driving now'.  I was back to normal, just like that.  It was as though I was out of space/time and I had the ability to choose when to return in.  I chose 4am, and when the clock hit 4am my trip ended, just like that.  I drove home, and was greated by my friends.  I have told this story a few times, and reactions are always differnt.\r\nAll I know, is after this 'trip' my spiritual life has grown quiet light.  I have found things in spirituality that interest me.  I've had a huge spiritual growth after this trip.  It gave me everything I hoped for.\n\n\n"
