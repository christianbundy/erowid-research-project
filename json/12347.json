 "report": [
  "This was my first time to experiment w/ Salvia. I was at my friends house around 2 p.m. I sat down on a rock, under a big tree. I took the first hit and I felt a little bit high, but not much. After taking the second hit and finishing the bowl I felt odd. My arms begin to feel either heavy or as if something was pulling them but in no direction. I shook my whole upper body to try and get feeling back in my arms. Then as I was talking w/ my friends my jaw begin to feel like my arms. Soon I forgot everything that happened previous to smoking the Salvia. I had a hard time talking b/c of the feeling in my jaw. I got scared and stood up to try and shake it off, but as I stood up my body was being pulled toward the spots of light that got through the shade of the tree. (not my whole body, just my arms and jaw) When I reached these spots of light my body would jerk and I would go on to another spot of light. I couldn't go anywhere except for the spots of light. Like I was connecting the dots.",
  "When I reached the limit of the shade I followed a little portion of it and forced myself to turn back to my friends. Then one of my friends and I pushed me inside. Then I got real hot and I began to calm down so to speak. My arms and jaw were back to normal and I was left w/ the thought of what just happened."
