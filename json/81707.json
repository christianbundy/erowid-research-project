 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: 30 mgs of DOM is considered an extremely high dose, see DOM Dose Chart]</p><p>It  was a Sunday  evening  and  I was  looking  forward  to a  short experience which would obviously  not  interfere with my work the next day.  I had  no previous experience with 2C-D so I  decided this was a good time to  test the substance. After checking  various sources and possible dosages my mind was set on a 30mg  experience (I considered also  40 and 50).  My drug recipients are all labeled  with popular name, trivial chemical name, structural formula and concentration (for liquids) to reduce the risk of taking in the wrong chemical. Despite all of this, I later discovered that I did, not much unlike the 100mg report of 2C-B in PiHKAL. It is all the more frightening, as I now recognize the many warnings and signs that manifested themselves, even in an  early stage, which I neglected and led to this incident which</p><p>luckily did not end in a disaster.</p><p>Medical context:    ADHD (with  medication). </p><p>Substance context:  had several experiences, mostly with  psychedelic drugs.</p><p>[22:00]  I ingested 30mg of the compound I held for 2C-D.  I remember the taste to be bitter, not quite good but not repulsive. It reminded me  strongly  of  2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM/STP).  The dilution was  2mg/mL which  seemed also slightly  off as I remembered that the HCl salts of the phenetylamines didn't dissolve very good,</p><p>but I couldn't  quite remember it well so I dismissed the feelings as uncertainty, driven by my own bad memory and the possible confusion with the closely related DOM.</p><p>[22:20] Early signs. </p><p>[23:20] I  marked this  point as 'start  of  peak', which seemed reasonable  for  2C-D.  There was also  a feeling of leveling  of intensity.</p><p>[23:20-24:00]  Euphoric phase. There was a profound self-appreciation, almost erotic. Music was superb. I lied down on my bed and watched the lights move  wildly with the music.  At one point I  couldn't make the difference anymore  between shadows and real objects.   There was also considerable  leg  tremor,  but  it  felt  particularly  pleasant.   A printout of a  tesseract projection came out in 3D  from the paper and</p><p>started moving and shifting in impossible ways. I began to worry about the intensity  which was not  at all in  line with common  reports for 2C-D.  I  again noticed a  close resemblance to a  previous experience with DOM/STP (which was also very  intense). I notify a friend, on the internet about the unexpected intensity but he is not online.</p><p>[00:00]  Instead of leveling, the intensity kept rising again. Worries increase. I was lying on the bed when 'it' started. I had an EXTREMELY intense jamais-vu  experience which suddenly set  off panic. Certainty dissolved almost  instantly, instead I  turned into a  paranoid being, trying to make the fear  go away with logic and self-comfort. Somehow, it still  worked and I could  enjoy brief moments of  music, light and mathematics.   I decided  to try  to contact  my friend  again on the internet (still  online). As I was  typing, I needed all  my effort to focus since the visual distortions  were at this point so intense that it was nearly impossible to observe any object longer than 1 second.</p><p>[00:10]  In just 10min the intensity  grew so  overwhelming I  started panicking. I  was torn apart in  doubt, fear and shame,  because I was now  certain that  something  was definately  wrong  and somehow  this '2C-D' was not 2C-D at all. Yet I felt a strong resistance to call for help, still  hoping it  would go away.   Instead, hope  slowly evolved into hopelessness  and desperation, as I  began to fear  for my mental</p><p>health.  There was  also a very weird headache  coming on; something I have never felt before.</p><p>[00:15](?)  My mind was now set on calling for help.  This didn't work very well, as it was very  difficult to handle my phone (I was shaking *a lot*  and it was difficult to remember  the exact steps to  find a phone number).  It is very hard  to describe what  happened next.  The closest  I can  think of,  is the  scene in  Terminator III  where the Terminator  is  infected  with  a  virus and  is  torn  apart  between destroying and  protecting Connor.  I  felt this way: my  mind started the commands to find the number  in the address book on the phone, but the commands were wrong and aborted  over and over again. Call - abort - call - abort - call - abort...  At the same time I felt the limit of what  one would call  'utter desperation'  and I  nearly sank  onto my knees,  crying, ready  to yell  for help  and the  feeling that  I was</p><p>having a  mental breakdown  or worse:  full-blown  psychosis.  My mind seemed to short-circuit and  thoughts were  multiplying,  ever louder, faster, and I just couldn't handle it anymore and then...</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>[00:20](?) I don't know how long I was out or what I was doing, but I was still standing  with my phone in  my hand in the hallway.  I had a clear moment and quickly called the number.</p><p>  X:  'Hello?' </p><p> Me: 'X!  I'm glad to hear you. Wait a second.'</p><p>  (... going outside, don't wake the house mate!) </p><p> Me: 'X, do you think 30mg is a good dose for 2C-D?'</p><p> X:  '30mg is a very good dose for 2C-D.'</p><p> Me: 'Still, this is  crazingly intense, I feel very anxious, and I</p><p> think I might not have made the brightest move to do this alone.</p><p> I'm totally dissociating and ...'</p><p>  X: 'Me,  do you want  me to come over and bring Clonazepam to stop</p><p> it?'</p><p>  Me: 'Yes, that would be good.'</p><p> X:  'OK, can you remember your house number?  I seem to have</p><p> forgotten'.</p><p>  Me:  .... (thinking...) 'No...' (panick)</p><p> X:  'OK, I...'</p><p>  Me: 'Wait! I  remember,  it's ####'. </p><p> X:  'OK, hang  on, don't do anything stupid, I'll come as fast as I</p><p> can.'</p><p>Knowing that help was coming, I  thought I could ease down my feelings but  I couldn't. Music  was distorted  and echoing,  (external) voices seemed to  multiply. Television was heavily distorted  and scary. Even the news, telephone games and cartoons. I could feel losing grip again and was fearing that X might come too late.</p><p>[12:30] I wake up my house mate and tell him what happened. He kept me company and  eased me  down. I'm  glad I made  this decision  and very grateful  for  his  help.  I'm  looking  at  the  clock like  every  5 seconds. Time  seemed to  move at different  speeds, I  feel extremely detached and I'm experiencing ridiculously strong derealization.</p><p>[01:00] At last, bell rings. X  rushes in and immediately gives me 4mg of Clonazepam. By that time it was nearly impossible for me to tell if what was happening was real, or fantasy.  I'm ordered to the couch and I ask X to explain to my roommate in detail (and coherently) what this is all  about.  I also tell him  that I'm now practically  sure that I must  have  gotten  the  wrong  chemical (still  not  considering the</p><p>possibility that I just took the wrong bottle!!) Anxiety fades but the psychedelic effects are  still as intense as they  were.  To the great amazement  of X, I  suddenly seemed  very clear,  prompt, awake  and I could  walk  around  easily  (4mg  Clonazepam should  put  me vastly asleep).</p><p>[~01:30] X now also thinks that something might be seriously wrong. We go upstairs and I give instructions on  how to get to my stash (I laid down on the bed  for safety). I KNEW the bottles of  2C-D and DOM were untouched before the start, so it was easy to check.  First bottle.</p><p>  X:  '2C-D. It's still sealed.'</p><p> Me: 'Crap. Quickly, look for the DOM.'</p><p>  X:  'DOM... It's open!!'</p><p> Me: 'F - * - C - K !!!'</p><p> Me: 'Sh*tsh*tsh*t what have I done!!'</p><p> Me: 'Don't we have to call 911 or something?'</p><p> X:  'Don't be so quick, get down on your bed and take this' (6 more</p><p>  mg of Clonazepam)</p><p>  X:  'Are you SURE about the dose?'</p><p> Me: 'Check my notebook, check my notebook, it's all in there!'</p><p> (X checks out: 30mg, 2mg/mL in the book 2mg/mL on the bottle)</p><p>[02:00] still  no sleep, visuals still  very intense, but  there is no more anxiety.</p><p>[08:00] X checks out, I continue sleeping.</p><p>[18:00] I wake up, total train wreck.</p><p>[Day+1] barely functional</p><p>[Day+2] I try to go to work.  I feel psychedelic on the road and there is still the headache.</p><p>[Day+7,00:30] Exactly one week after the mental breakdown (almost down to the minute!!), I have a bad panic attack and I feel the same weird headache as 1 week ago.</p><p>[Next  weeks] Several panic attacks  per day  (about  3-10), sometimes quite  intense.  Severe  memory  impairment. Some  things go  smoother though,  such as  improvising  at  the piano.  </p><p>[About  1 month  later] Applied very small  therapeutic dose of 2C-B (4.5mg):  no problems, no panic.</p><p>[9 months later] I have  done several more psychedelic experiments. I'm now much  more prone to anxiety  during come-up, but  it ALWAYS turned out OK.  Every  now and then I have light panic  attacks, but they are manageable.</p><p>I  do  consider  myself as  intelligent  enough,  yet  it was  my  own stupidity and  negligence that led  to this situation, which  may very well have lead to my death. No discussion about drugs go by or my mind wanders about what would have happened if I would have chosen the 50mg experience. Or if the mistake was between 2C-B/DOB. Or what would have happened if X was not there  (I cannot thank you enough for this). I'm</p><p>not  ready to  leave  the psychedelic  experience  yet, and  I do  not consider this DOM overdose as useless -- instead during the come-up it has shown  me a view on  the potential which  is now, as I  write this text, just barely  opening up to let  me in. It has also  shown me the other side, the side of myself that  I did not want to see, the limits of what  I can bare  and the face  of utter desperation  which finally defined my true self in a way I could not predict.</p>",
