 "report": "<p>Until recently, I was a heavy cannabis user--an abuser, really. For the past three years at least I had smoked three to five times per day: driving on the way to work, on the way home, alone in my apartment, etc. Then, about three weeks ago, I threw my last half-burned joint out of the window of my car and haven't smoked since, determined that I wouldn't do so again until I could convince myself that I could live my life without dependence.</p><p>There has been much debate on whether or not heavy marijuana users are likely to experience any withdrawal symptoms; some sources say none exist, others say moderate ones are to be expected. I would like to add my two cents to the debate with an endorsement of the former theory. I have experienced none of the classic withdrawal symptoms since I quit (save the occasional craving to light up, but I suppose that's more out of habit than anything). Moreover, it's like my consciousness has been lifted out of a fog. In the admittedly short time since I stopped, I've eaten better, I've been more alert and able to focus and concentrate, and I've been much more sociable, and my mood has generally improved.</p><p>I'm not cancelling my membership with NORML, and I imagine I'll light up again sometime, possibly in the not-too-distant future. But having tasted and remembered the virtues of sobriety once again, I'm not going to let myself slip back into the abusive habits in which I let so much of my life slip away.</p>",
