  "My first experience with meth was not very pleasing.  I did a small line which made my nose burn.  The drip was pretty bad.  And I was told to swallow the taste, and not try and spit it out.  Shortly after, my heart began to race and I felt very uncomfortable.  I ended up being scared out of my mind all night. ",
  "I didn't plan on using meth again.  Then my friends started snorting lines regularly on the weekends.  I joined in with them just to stay up all night and have long conversations. I was beginning to have more of an enjoyable experience with the drug.",
  "Then the wierdness kicked in.  We started smoking off of foil, and my friend spilled a sack.  She began scraping the floor and trying to find the lost contents of the sack.  She ended up smoking lint and pieces of the ceiling. ",
  "I began using a glass pipe shortly after.  I smoked nearly a 20.00 sack everyother day.  The fun was beginning to wear off.  My funds were running low, and going to school was becoming nearly impossible.",
  "I ended up failing an entire semester of classes.  Being only 16, my family was very concerned.  I confessed to them that I was using and felt I had a problem.  But that didn't keep me from using.",
  "I got arrested at the age of 17 for breaking and entering.  That was no fun.  And it all started because I needed a safe place to hit my pipe.  I then realized I needed to shape up.",
  "I quit using for a short period of time.  Then, at the age of 18, I began smoking 1/2 gram daily.  I was out of my mind 99% of the time.  During this time, I experienced psychotic episodes, severe wieght loss, paranoia, sleep deprivation,  heart problems, and kidney problems.",
  "I finally quit for good right before my 19th birthday.  The comedown was nothing short of hellish.  I couldn't move, my body ached and I kept vommiting up whatever I ate.  The worst part of the comedown though, was the severe depression, paranoia and anxiety.",
  "For five months, I suffered with severe depression, paranoia and anxiety.  During that time, I was clean, but definately not a functioning member of society.  I now have 7 and 1/2 months clean time, and finally I can feel normal.",
  "I would not recommend this drug if you have a compulsive nature.  Personally, I will never touch any illegal substance again.  The time it took me to recover from my drug use is not worth a weekend of tweaking."
