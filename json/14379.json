  "[Erowid Note: 24 grams of morning glory seeds is considered an extremely high dose, see morning glory Dose Chart]",
  "Mindset - Good mood, relaxed, relatively happy",
  "Preparations - None",
  "Prelude:  Prior to this night, I had tried LSA once before.  I had eaten 6.5 grams of Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds about 4 months before, and felt nothing other than a slight buzz and minor CEVs.  On this night, my friends J and M and I were in the mood to 'trip', and we decided to try a larger dose of Morning Glory seeds.  At ACE hardware, we acquired 4 5 gram packs of seeds each, giving us each a dose of 20 grams.  When we arrived back at M's, we discovered that he had 6 2 gram packs of seeds left over from our previous purchase.  Dividing these evenly between us, we each had a dose of 24 grams.",
  "T+0:  We began eating the seeds straight out of the pack.  The package claimed that the seeds had not been sprayed/treated with chemicals in any way.  This grew to be a daunting task, due to the hardness and horrible taste of the seeds.",
  "T+30 min.: After half an hour of hardcore crunching and gagging, I had successfully ingested my seeds.  M had given up after eating about 15 grams, but J had also finished all of his packs.  I will now report what I wrote/had M write for me in a notebook during the experience.",
  "T+1 hr.:  Slight giddy and cold feeling felt.  Also seeing visual disturbances, such as 'breathing' surfaces and light tie-dye colored patterns over my visual field.",
  "T+2 hr.:  Effects have GREATLY intensified.  I now realize that I have taken far too large of a dose.  My vision is completely obscured by the colorful patterns and objects that are constantly present.  I am also having extreme stomach pains and feel like I have poisoned myself.  I do not want to vomit, since I want to experience a strong trip on psychedelics.",
  "T+4 hr.:  Effects are even stronger.  The nausea and stomach pain have been reduced, due to ingestion of 1 small hit of marijuana.  I am now unable to comprehend reality.  The trip is extremely pleasurable at this time, and I am enjoying it, despite the strength.",
  "At T+5 hr.:  We decided to attempt to go to sleep.  This is when the trip took a turn for the worst and is 'When I Went Insane'.  I will now resume commentary on major events I remember.",
  "T+5 hr. 30 min.:  While attempting to go to sleep, I noticed that the colors and visual patterns would NOT go away.  If I closed my eyes, they simply grew more intense and brighter.  My mind was racing, thinking thousand of conflicting thoughts every second.  I began to become afraid that I had permanently 'fried my brain', and would never return to normal.  I looked over at J, and exclaimed 'I NEED TO FIND REALITY!!  WHERE IS REALITY?'  He responded 'Same!'  It appeared that he was in the same situation as I.",
  "T+7 hr.:  After living in my insane state for 2 hours, I began to adjust.  The trip was plateau-ing at this time, and was still going strong.  Since it was 3 A.M. and dark out, I didn't know that it was raining.  I began to hear a noise.  In my inebriated/altered state, it sounded like M was masturbating.  I didn't want to look over at M to verify this, since I still felt somewhat nauseous and it would have caused me to vomit. ",
  "I yelled out 'M, you fucking sick bastard.  What the hell do you think you are doing.  Here I am, fucking delusional and I'm dying and you are masturbating.  FUCK YOU! STOP MASTURBATING!'  He replied 'I'm not masturbating dude, it's raining.'  I thought he was trying to trick me, so this comment just further angered me and aggravated my already shaken mindstate.  I continued repeating 'Fuck you, M.  You sick fuck.' every few minutes for the next 2 hours, since I kept hearing the supposed 'masturbation sound' in my state, I completely forgot that no one could possibly masturbate for that long of a time.",
  "I finally fell asleep about 3 hours after this event occured.  When I woke up at T+13, I was still tripping HARD.  I had to go home, but didn't want to endanger myself and others by driving in that state.  I called my mom, and rambled off some shit like 'Hi mom I'm insane so I need a ride home.  I think I'm dead.  Is this the afterlife?' and such things.  After dropping off J at his house, mom asked me what I had done.  At this time I had managed to hide my marijuana/hallucinogen use from her for 4 years.  I told her that I had smoked too much weed and would be fine in a few hours. ",
  "As soon as I arrived at my house, I went to bed.  I slept for 12 hours and woke up at 1 A.M.  When I woke up, I had pretty much returned to baseline.  However, I still had minor open eye visual patterns for 2 weeks after the ingestion, and, to this day, about a year and a half after ingestion, I can stll see faint visual disturbances if I stare at an object.  These disturbances consist of seeing the 'breathing surfaces' phenomenon and seeing slight color patterns on the object.",
  "Moral of the story - I am not trying to convince anyone to not take LSA or other hallucinogens.  If you decide to try Morning Glory seeds, please have the common sense to take a moderate dose and not vastly overdo it like I did.  Completely losing your mind for a day is NOT fun."
