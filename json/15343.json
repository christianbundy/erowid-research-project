  "<p>I want this report to help out those who are looking into Tramadol in comparison to other well-known opiates.",
  "I'll start this off the traditional way, by giving a little background. My drug library includes Alcohol, Pot, DXM, Mushrooms, Cocaine, Barbituates, Hydrocodone, Codeine, Oxycodone. My drug type of choice is Opiates. I have a good amount of experience in the field of this drug type.",
  "The first time I got to try Tramadol was while trying to purchase Percocets. The latter fell through so I went with the Tramadols which I had previously read about. Tramadol always struck me as having a very weak high from what I read. Some classify it as a non-opiate, some as a quasi-opiate, but from what I can tell it's an opiate to me.",
  "At three dollars a pill I jumped on the deal. Now the difference with most of these other reports is that the drug used in them is a generic form of Tramadol. Generic forms are, from experience, much weaker than the brand name counterparts. I don't know why this is, but I also remember when I had Endocets, they were much weaker than Percocets.",
  "Ultracets are what the Tramadols were labelled as. They contain 37.5 mg of Tramadol, and 325 mg of generic Tylenol. Since generic Tramadol have 50 mg, it seems like it will be weaker. But trust me, this is far from the truth. Read on and I will compare the drug to other opiates as well as give a general description of what I felt at the time.",
  "4:15 - I ingest 2 - 37.5 mg pills. I have eaten McDonalds about 2 hours earlier so it's not a fully empty stomach.",
  "4:35 - Very mild stomach pains. For some reason I feel like I'm not going to feel anything because of all the negative stuff I have read.",
  "4:45 - A very mild Codeine-like high is coming over me. It could be placebo effects, but I kind of feel it's more than just that. Personally, I hate the Codeine high. It's super mild and just has a weird feeling about it. By now I have given up on Tramadol as a good drug.",
  "5:00 - My girlfriend comes over and we go for a drive to get her something to eat. Very slowly I find myself in a Hydrocodone-like high. It is very nice at this point. Just looking out the window puts a smile on my face. Also talking is pleasurable. Not only do I feel the euphoria, I feel energetic. It is kind of odd because I almost forgot I had taken the drug since I had given up on it.",
  "5:50 - The feeling is going strong. It is not like the powerful oxycodone high that washes over you in a strong but short wave. It reminds me more of about 10-15 mgs of hydrocodone. The energy is a much welcome element to an opium high. Opiates usually make me very tired. This extra energy boost seemed to help me get more out of the high. My mind could fully appreciate the wonderful world of this drug.",
  "7:25 - I get home and let me tell you, watching TV is awesome right now. I keep getting up to look for things to do. I set up a dart board, played darts, and found a keyboard. Playing the keyboard is something I have found amazing to do, on or off drugs. Although on drugs, it always seems to promote more creativity. I was coming up with awesome little tunes and enjoying them as I listened. Laying with a loved one on this drug is also as pleasurable as it gets. Im loving this new found delight.",
  "8:35 - This is odd. Opiate highs never last more than 2-3 hours with me. Even the 2-3 hours consists of 1 hour of euphoria with a 1-2 hour come down. The high I have right now is just as strong as the high at 5,6, and 7 o'clock. This is amazing. I've never been in this state of mind for this long and I'm loving it.",
  "9:00 - I start watching Animal House. I'm realizing that I don't have to be just sitting down, I actually have energy where I could be getting things done instead of the usual, 'I'm on an opiate, let me lay in bed and close my eyes'. There isn't anything to do though, so I stay seated. I haven't eaten or been hungry since I ingested the pills.",
  "10:00 - It's been 6 hours since ingestion, and 5 hours since the great feeling took over. I can feel a slight comedown. It's just as subtle as it came into effect. It is still going pretty strong though.",
  "11:00 - I start writing out the report and by the time I'm done it's gone. I have a mild cramp but its nothing big, probably from not eating. I was a little itchy, but thats gone as well. This was on of the best opiates I have done so far. The length, energy boost, and good old opiate flavor made this a drug of choice.",
  "Tomorrow I plan to do 3(112.5 mg Tramadol HCL, 975 mg generic tylenol). I know that opiates build tolerance levels, so it might not be effective. This will be the final test. If it can do it's magic more than once, it will truely be 'better than the rest'.",
  "The chart below rates opiates I have tried (with a relative, moderate dosage), displaying different qualities of various types on a scale of 1(weak)-10(strong).",
  "Opiates           |  High  |  Length  | Bad Side Effects*",
  "---------------------------------------------------------",
  "Oxycodone(5mg)    |  10.0  |   2.0    |       2.0",
  "Hydrocodone(15mg) |   7.5  |   6.0    |       2.0",
  "Tramadol(70mg)    |   8.0  |  10.0    |       2.5",
  "Codeine(120mg)    |   1.0  |   2.5    |       7.0",
  "Everything on this chart is how I react to these chemicals. Everyone is different as stated on the nifty subtext of this site ;).",
  "*The bad side effects category is things such as difficulty breathing, itchiness, pain afterwards or during, etc.",
  "Well I hope this helped clear things up about this new and UNSCHEDULED drug. It is an easy substitute for any opiate shy of Morphine in my opinion.",
  "Have fun and stay healthy.</p>"
