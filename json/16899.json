 "report": "<p>This was probably my 5th or 6th mushroom experiment.  On previous excursions I never had any hallucinations, just an altered mental state and pleasing body high.  My friend Slick and I wanted to try one last time before heading off to school, but we only had one gram of Cubensis for each of us.  So we tried to make the best of it. Slick, another friend who chose not to indulge, and myself all headed out to one of our family's ranch.  After arriving we set up 3 hammocks, and Slick and I started with a little Marijuana to hopefully ward off any possible nausea which might result from the Harmala.  About half an hour after the Marijuana we went to work on the Harmala brew.</p><p>We had used the lemon-water/boiling extraction method for 7 grams of Harmala.  We split this brew in two and poured our share into Dr. Pepper to help disguise the taste.  Neither of us had tasted it before but we had read terrible accounts of it.  Well what we read still didn't prepare us for the evil taste of that drink.  Words can't even describe it.  I don't know about Slick, but it was by far the worst tasting thing I had ever put in my mouth.  The most wretched part was the 'after-taste'.  I thought I would surely puke due to taste alone.  But I spaced the drink out over 10 minutes or so and managed not to.  I had fasted for about 20 hours, which must have helped prevent nausea.  I'm sure the Marijuana helped a bit as well. After ingestion we went to lay in the hammocks for half an hour.  I could definately feel the difference as the Harmala did her work.  It is very hard to describe and I didn't write down what I was feeling at the time.  Suffice it to say that we were affected by the Harmala alone. 30 minutes after drinking the brew, we ingested our one gram dried Cubensis.</p><p>Set:  I was really looking forward to the experience.  I know myself well enough that I had no fear of a bad trip.  We had done the research and were expecting a positive experience.  I couldn't wait to see what God had in store for me this time.  I was taking no medications and had only water and that one Dr. Pepper in me at the start.</p><p>Setting:  Southwestern cattle ranch.  Beautiful golden fields, surrounding woods, clear blue sky.  No music, which was a first.  3 hammocks.</p><p>Experience:  It's tough to say how long it took to kick in.  It seemed much faster than normal, though I wasn't looking at my watch.  I would say I was definitely feeling it within 30 minutes and was peaking an hour to an hour and a half after ingestion of the mushrooms.  My thoughts began to soar.  The setting was one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced.  I could see the wind blow across the fields and feel it then soar through my body, energizing me in the progress.  The wind was the most lovely thing I've ever felt on my body.  It was like a spiritual massage.  Everything looked perfect.  If I looked down at the dirt and let my eyes un-focus, patterns instantly emerged which I'd never seen before.  The patterns began to bulge, slither, and twist.  I wish I could explain to you what I was thinking throughout all this. I went to write some of it down, but realized I wasn't really thinking in words the whole time.  Writing was a bit difficult so I didn't keep it up for long.  A tape recorder would have been more suitable.  As usual with mushrooms, my thoughts were constantly fluctuating between extremely broad and extremely detailed.  Here is what I did manage to transcribe, which were the more simplistic of my thoughts:</p><p>'I'm writing this as it happens.  It's actually very difficult to describe.  How can I possibly put some form of human logic to this?  My handwriting looks terrible.  I actually don't write much. I'm always on the computer.  Writing seems so human and foolish.  Forget it.'</p><p>'This looks pitiful.  Hopefully, we will one day have a method of transcribing our thoughts to a more pure form.  A keyboard (computer) is progress, but we need something better.'</p><p>'Sometimes it's too beautiful to take.'</p><p>This bit came while drinking a Vanilla Coke, which I really enjoyed:</p><p>'Throughout all the God I'm feeling, there is always in the background... VANILLA.  I've never felt the spirit of a taste, until now.'</p><p>So all in all it was an AMAZING experience.  I felt enriched just to have witnessed what I saw/felt/heard/tasted.  It wasn't as weird as the typical mushroom trip, which was a nice change of pace.  I thought just as much, but seemed to feel much more.  I feel no need to do it again any time soon, and probably won't have the opportunity.  But once I do, be it a month or a few years, I will definitely try P. Harmala and P. Cubensis again.</p>",
