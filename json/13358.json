  " 2 reports for the price of one!",
  " Around October of 2000, some friends and i were going to have",
  "a typical smoke session. Maybe 5 people, some high quality",
  "weed. Well, i had a bunch of mushroom shake left from a party,",
  "and i threw it on top. Why not? I had to work in an hour and",
  "a half and figured the weed would be fading by then.",
  "So we toked it all down. Pretty soon i felt totally stoned",
  "out of my gourd. And more, it had the definate feel of mushrooms",
  "too. Great i thought, its really nice. But by the time work",
  "rolled around, i was still feeling like dancing through happy",
  "land. I had to call in with a lame excuse.",
  " Now, Aughust 2001, im sitting in japan (mushrooms are legal",
  "here by the way). I just packed a bowl full of mushroom shake",
  "and burnt down. Well, its definately giving some effects. Mild",
  "visual changes, sound and tactile perceptions are slightly mushroomy. Nice feeling.",
  " So, i can say mushroom smoking has an effect. However, the taste is rather bad, and usually causes a mild headache. Definately interesting though. If you have only 1 or 2 caps, or a bunch of shake, id say smoke the stuff, but use some weed to kill the taste."
