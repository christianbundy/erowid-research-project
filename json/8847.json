 "report": "<p>This was my first experience with Salvia Divinorum and I had done several days worth of research before trying it. When I received the dried leaves I waited until dark and then instructed my sitter to be as quite as possible. I sat in front of our sliding glass door and proceeded to take two huge puffs from my Proto Pipe. The smoke was extremely hot as I expected and I held the two hits for about 20-30 seconds each. I exhaled and loaded the pipe again, but began to feel its effects.  I had the feeling of being alone, similar to how I have felt during the onset of mushrooms and LSD. I puffed two more times holding each the same length of time as before. I went to shut the sliding door and notice a change in perspective. It is like the feeling I get when smoking pot, but without the euphoria. I laid back onto the floor where I had placed a pillow for my head. I began to feel the heat surround the places on my body that were in contact with the floor. </p><p>I closed my eyes and tried to offer myself to the 'Goddess'. It took only a few seconds before I realized the signature pull to my left. It felt as if I were made of liquid and I was being pulled horizontally through a tube or drain. The feeling was amazing and I only wished it would have gotten stronger and pulled me into the other worlds I had read about. I was dissappointed when I heard the 'meow' of my cats and opened my eyes to find then all around my head wondering what I was doing on the floor. I must admit, there is no way to truely appreciate this plant if you are disturbed by any outside stimulus. I have set up another journey to take place in the mountains of Colorado within the next few weeks. I look forward to seeing the power behind this plant and to have it teach me more about my place in the universe.</p>",
