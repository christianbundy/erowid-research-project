 "report": [
  "Alright, this was by far my best ecsasy experience ever, but before I get into that, let me start with some background:",
  "The drugs I had taken prior to this event were: MDMA, mushrooms, LSD, weed, absinthe, alcohol, and salvia. So you could say I was a fairly experienced user. Although I am extremely skinny for my height, I am 6 feet tall and I weigh 115lbs with 2% body fat. I tend to have a high tolerance to substances, I can easily down 15 beers and be a little tipsy but nothing near drunk. And my previous rolls had been good, however they were nothing like what I was about to experience.",
  "Although I like to take substances with friends and go parties and live the 'college life', sometimes I like to solo roll. I feel that when having a solo trip I can do whatever I want without someone else sitting there saying 'That doesn't sound like something that would be fun.' I am a spontaneous person and quite random at times, in my opinion life can be quite dull and it is our job to spice it up and make it as exciting as possible. I have found very few people that appreciate that about me and those are the people that I truthfully have the greatest time with, intoxicated or not.",
  "Although I had rolled solo before and those experiences were decent and somewhat disappointing due to the pills I had, I was looking forward to this one. It had been about a month and a half since I had rolled previously.",
  "The preload:",
  "I had been reading online about preloading before taking ecstasy. Preloading is taking certain vitamins to boost your seratonin levels before a roll and taking things to better absorb the MDMA. I figured that I would try it, so I started taking 3000mg of vitamin c, 100mg of vitamin b-6, and 100mg of 5-htp, every morning for 3 days before the roll. I noticed a slight lift in mood and energy on these days before dropping, which just added to the overwhelming anticipation of the drop.",
  "Drop day",
  "-----------------------------",
  "11:00am : I woke up and ate a large breakfast, as that would be my last meal for a while. Consisted of three eggs, a few pieces of bacon and some fruit and a fruit smoothie. While eating I took 4000mg of vitamin C, 200 mg of 5-htp, and 200mg of b-6 with grapefruit juice to increase absorption. I decided to clean up my place, clean my bong out and then I made a grocery list of things that I believe are essential for a roll, which include:",
  "-Vicks Inhalers (for the nose), I also use this to blow into my eyes, feels AMAZING while rolling. However I do not reccommend this due to the lack of information I have regarding the safety of doing this.",
  "-Big jug of orange juice for vitamin c and the great taste.",
  "-Some emergency (the 1,000 mg vitamin c supplement) for a little boost during the roll.",
  "-A few glow sticks and some string to attach then to my floor fan",
  "-Some mentholatum for the nose, as well as vicks :D",
  "Once I arrived home I had a few last preparations to do before I waited for the time to come to drop. I had to make sure to make many ice cubes and get my micro-mink blankets washed and dried for maximum softness. Now was time to wait until drop time.",
  "8:00pm :",
  "It had been about 9 hours since I ate my large breakfast. I took two tums to minimize stomach restlessness due to the fact I have a naturally 'nervous' stomach and very severe acid reflux since the age of 12, and then 2000mg more of vitamin C. I took two red bic men which I knew were pure MDMA due to a testing kit. I had been reading on different ways of consuming these 'wonder pills' and I wasn't too into plugging (up the bum) although I have heard great results doing that method. I decided on parachuting mixed with some chewing and taking some whole. I parachuted the first (which is crushing the pill up and putting it in a napkin). Then about 10 minutes later I took the second but I chewed up half and left half solid. Normally when I take rolls my stomach doesn't feel right the entire night from the time I drop until I eat next. However, this time I noticed that my stomach felt great, I attribute it to the tums I took, they helped immensely. I was feeling anxious and ready for it to come on because I was so excited about what was going to happen I just wanted it to happen!",
  "T + 30 min:",
  "So I decided a good way to pass the time would be to sit on the couch and start watching the television, it was football which is something that I enjoy watching. I am thinking I should start feeling the rolls very soon, hopefully within 20 minutes due to very fast metabolism and empty stomach contents. So I am sitting watching the game and not feeling anything at all for about 30 minutes, then 35 minutes, then 40!! I am sitting here wondering if they are just bad pills and have so very little MDMA that I can't feel it, although deep down I know that isn't it because I have had these before and I tested them. So I get up and decide to do some wind sprints to get my heart pumping and hopefully speed up the process as well to take my mind off of the fact that it wasn't working. I run these for about 5 minutes, then up the stairs in my apartment and down a few dozen times, then I sit back down on the couch. About 5 minutes later, I start to feel a little tingle.",
  "T + 60 min:",
  "The Ride to the Top of the Mountain: All of a sudden, almost like the MDMA slapped me in the face saying 'GET READY', I get this intense warm almost orgasmically amazing feeling in my tummy and it just starts radiating out from my stomach like being consumed slowly by the 'blanket' of ecstasy speeding through my body. I am moving on the couch but everything feels so amazing that I can't move. I think to myself 'Oh boy, get ready for this.' I decide to go upstairs and lie in my bed where I have the 2 very very soft blankets that I washed earlier as well as a flannel cover. When I go to get up my body feels so amazing, the only way to explain the feeling is that my whole body feels like when a body apart falls asleep but with heat and the most amazing feeling ever, almost like someone was pouring a constant stream of warm water over my body but multiplied a few thousand times. I get to the steps and I just start crawling up them because the ecstasy is too great to walk up them, but in a good way. When I am crawling up these steps, I felt like my body was 3 feet behind where it actually was, and if I stopped moving I felt it catch up to me almost like a trail, like the one you can put on your mouse in windows.",
  "T + 90 min:",
  "I get into my room, throw on a techno playlist I started earlier and get into bed. I don't normally listen to techno, but when I am rolling, I have to have it. I also have an orange glow stick, this bright green fuzzy ball and a blacklight. I turn the fan on that has the glowsticks tied to the fan blades and that just starts a multi-colored circle of amazingness. So I had everything I wanted but moving felt too good that I couldn't handle it I just laid there in pure bliss. I laid in bed for about 30 minutes just dancing to the music and laying in bed it was amazing. I called an old friend of mine who I used to roll with and talked to him. This is when it really began to kick in.",
  "T + 120 min:",
  "The Beautiful Summit That is Ecstasy: As I lay in my bed I get these rushing feelings and I really REALLY want to go for a run. Granted it is MAYBE 5 degress fahrenheit, a cold winter in Colorado. I find this super soft sweater, but it is only soft on the outside, so I flip it around and put it on, then my snowboarding coat. I grab a beanie, get my vicks and put some on a rag to bring, and of course, my Ipod. I feel that music is one of the most important parts to any experience. I also have these soft sweat pants under my jeans to increase the softness. I get outside and it feels amazing, the cold air and the vicks mix together to make the most amazing feeling breathing in and out. So I just started running, almost like Forrest Gump. I didn't care where I was going, all I knew was that running and moving felt so good. Ever since I was a kid I was extremely active, I played soccer for 11 years and ran track, so going for a run seemed like a natural thing to do. Up the ice-covered sidewalk I go, I run for about 7 blocks then turn back.",
  "I run into little playground with swings, 'SWINGS!' I thought. Almost as if they were meant to be there begging me to ride them, I happily comply. I get on the swing and the stars are so bright and beautiful, the body high is the pure ecstasy that you get when rolling, however I had not ever felt it like this before, no other words descirbe it. It felt like I was being shot through a tube of fuzz at high speed and had body tracers up and down my body. Once I start to actually swing, the sensation is like I am laying on a cloud and just slowly rocking back and forth in the middle of the sky. My body is warm, maybe too warm, even though it is so cold out. I feel like I could stay on this swing forever, the vicks makes it more intense. I knew I had to go back, so I left the swing and then said a long goodbye to the park which I just had one of the best times of my life in.",
  "T + 2 hours :",
  "I make my run home and I can feel myself coming down a bit. Once I get home I make myself a 2,000mg vit c drink and chug some orange juice as well. I feel right as rain again, ready to do whatever. I load my clean bong and blaze it up. The two substances mix and make a great combination. I sit and watch my fan spin, colored dots on the wall and dancing to the music I put on my 1000w stereo with my subwoofer. I feel the music almost being 'pushed' through me, as I drift off into what one would call a trance.",
  "T + 4 hours :",
  "All I remember is coming to and being in the same spot but undressed, in my sweat pants and t-shirt. I feel the MDMA has tapered off substantially, however I can still feel lady MDMA hanging around. I blaze a little more and decide to listen to some more music and watch some television. This is around 5 in the morning and I realize I should probably start to come down and get ready to sleep. I don't have anything important to do the next day, but sleeping till 4pm isn't something I like to do.",
  "T + 7",
  "Food, Vitamins, Sleep....: I made myself a ham sandwich for some protein, and had a fruit smoothie drink to drink. I post loaded with 4000mg of vitamin c, 300 mg vitamin b-g, 300mg of 5-HTP, and some L-glutamine for the joints. I went upstairs and slept for the next 8 hours and felt great when I woke up.",
  "Conclusion:",
  "Preloading was absolutely amazing, it boosted the power of these pills tremendously! I had taken these on a previous occasion and they weren't like they were the second time (same batch).  Overall the experience was amazing and I hope to preload next time as well!"
