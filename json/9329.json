 "report": [
  "My first experience with marijuana was with the guys in the apartment above me. I knew them all very well, so one evening they were like, if you want to try smoking, here's a bong full. After going my whole life without having tried it, I figured once couldn't hurt.",
  "And it didn't. This first time was nice. I was comfortable, sitting on a couch, watching Da Ali G show, eating chips. So I figured, hey, why not, this stuff is fun. I'm not worried about the consequences, as I live in a College environment, where it is practically expected, so I might as well keep using it.",
  "The second time I tried, I was at my friend D's house. It was already a sort of eerie evening, as the walk over it was pouring rain. I did not know anyone else in the room but D, so just the setting was a bit uncomfortable. One of his friends was rolling a blunt, which I proceeded to take 4 massive hits off of. I felt nothing for the first 10 minutes, as I was sitting there watching TV. I started slowly noticing the effects taking place, similar to those of the first time. But after about another 10 minutes I felt a very strange pull on my body towards the TV. And before I knew it, I felt as if I was watching the TV in person. Everything that was on the TV seemed like it was right in front of me. Everyone else in the room was gone.",
  "I am not sure how long it was after this happened, but my friend D asked if I wanted anything to drink. I snapped out of the TV vision for a bit and got up and walked to the kitchen. When I was in the kitchen, I could not pour water out of the Brita, and quickly noticed how unable I was to function. I took a big gulp of water expecting it to help, but instead I felt like I was having a minor panic attack. I do think this was more mental than anything. I went to the bathroom to splash some water on my face to maybe bring myself down. While I was in the bathroom, I quickly found myself in pure fear looking at my face in the mirror. I felt like this was both the first and last time I was ever going to truly SEE myself. I found myself praying to God to bring me down off this horrible drug. While I am a fairly religious person, I found myself believing in God more than ever at this moment, as I was fearing perhaps I was going to die.",
  "I was able to regain focus for short periods of time to remind myself I was going to be ok, but these would quickly disappear. My friend D knocked at the door, and asked if I was ok. I was able to bring myself together and tell him I needed to go home. I feel like this would have all been fine had I just sat down and let him talk me down a bit, as I am willing to bet 99.9% of this panic attack was mental, and could have easily been brought under control.",
  "On the walk home, I found myself seeing INSIDE myself. As if I could see inside my head looking out. It was a very bizzare visual that would occur every time I closed my eyes. When I finally got home and laid down, I could not lie on my stomach, because when I did I would have my face pressed against a pillow causing more of these CEVs. For about an hour I debated calling somebody. I was thinking about calling my mom. I thought about calling 911. It was a very frightening feeling. After a few hours, I must have fallen asleep, as I woke up the next morning, still very high. Although now I felt much better, and realized that the effects had faded, making me realize I was going to be fine within the next few hours.",
  "I laid on the couch for the rest of the day, watching TV, taking short naps, and at around 6 that night, I felt completley fine again. I have smoked periodically since then, but haven't experienced the same intensity as that second smoke.",
  "While I do not think smoking weed is necessarily wrong, I find it to be much more powerful then some believe."
