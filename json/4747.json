  "this being my first experience with salvia, i was very nervous, yet anxious to see the effects....i have never experimented with anything other than cannabis, so you can imagine my nevousness.",
  "i sat alone in my dark apartment listening to Aphex Twin, hitting the bong one good time i recall thinking to myself i should have a sitter. by this time it was too late. my body grew numb and i remeber feeling only my right side still in reality, whereas my left side felt like it was being pulled away from me. shortly after i began to feel more nervous, but excited. i could hear my heart beating, thumping hard in my chest as if it were knocking against my insides. as a cold sweat drenched my face i slowly eased back to what i thought was my reality. as i stand to turn my light back on,i feel as if i am in water....no, i am water....later after slightly coming down, i realized that i am standing in my living room almost dancing or swaying in a way that the oceans waves would move. to say the least, it was a wierd experience i plan on persuing in the near future."
