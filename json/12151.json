  "Recently, I have been interested in finding legal highs.  I found quite a bit of information off the internet, including this site.  As I looked at the list, nutmeg struck my fancy.  I thought, 'I can get high on NUTMEG??'  I have tried it a few times, and they all had their ups and downs.  I thought I'd share my most recent experience.",
  "I went down to the grocery store and bought an ounce of ground nutmeg (expensive stuff!  not exactly something I'd buy very often).  Since I know how crappy this stuff tastes, I took the liberty of putting the nutmeg powder into gelcaps.  The gelcaps were not empty, so I emptied out the stuff that was in it, and packed the nutmeg in there real tight.  It equaled out to about 22 capsules or so.  I promptly swallowed them all accompanied by a big glass of water.  Cool!  Now all I had to do was wait.  About an hour later I ate dinner.  Just as I finished, the effects came on quickly.  It was uncomfortable... pretty shitty feeling.  It felt as if little bugs were crawling under my skin.  No matter what I did, I could not get comfortable.  I was irritible and just decided to lay down for a while.  I did feel slight nausea, as if my body was telling me it does not approve of this crap I took.",
  "This uncomfortable and irritating feeling lasted for about 2 hours, and I wish it would just end!  I had called a friend over and was seriously thinking of calling the night off and telling him to go home.  But the tension slowly passed, and it felt as if I was not high any more.  But one thing, I had the taste of nutmeg in my mouth!  I don't know how this is possible, but everything I ate tasted like nutmeg.  I ate some cookies, and the taste was STILL there.  Finally, after having some ice cream, the taste went away.  My friend and I watched and episode of SNL later that night (about 2 hours later).  I was laughing my head off like never before!  I know SNL is funny, but damn, I couldn't stop laughing!  This was the feeling I was looking for.  It wasn't so much of a 'high' feeling, but I felt mellow and had a case of the chuckles.  The only uncomfortable part was the dry mouth, which lasted long into the next morning.",
  "The next morning was fun also... but in a different way.  I was SOOO hungry and thirsty.  Eating never felt so good in my entire life!  Every gulp of my turkey sandwich and soda was pure ecstacy!  I ate a lot that day, and never seemed to be full.  This hungry/thirsty feeling lasted until the late evening and went away.",
  "Overall, it was not even close to a hallucinogenic experience, but it was very amusing.  I think if you have the time, try nutmeg.  But be careful on your dosage, don't overdue it.",
  "Peace!"
