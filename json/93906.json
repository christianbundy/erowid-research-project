 "report": "<p>Just recently I tried an experiment, somewhat similar to extracting DMT but using more benign chemicals. I got a good handful of betel nuts and put them in a large pot. I would have used about a liter of water. I added about a cupful of normal vinegar. After simmering on a low heat for about 6 hours I strained the mixture through some muslin cloth. I put the mixture back on the stove for another couple of hours. When there was about a centimeter of water left I slowly added some sodium bicarbonate until it no longer fizzed. I noticed there was a slight oily layer on top so I added a dash of vinegar until it was gone. I let the mixture boil down to a paste, lowering the heat some more so it didn't burn. Then I scraped the paste using a kitchen spatula and put it into a bag.</p><p>Using enough to cover the end of a kitchen knife (somewhat similar to the amount you would use in smoking opium or hash) I put it in my mouth with a similar amount of sodium bicarbonate. I held it there for a minute or so. The buzz was somewhat like a strong coffee, with a clear mind. Not really anything like an amphetamine or stronger substances. About 20 minutes later the buzz was replaced with a slight nausea and dizziness, nothing to worry about. Within 45 minutes the experience was completely gone. Well, it was a nice little experiment anyway.</p>"
