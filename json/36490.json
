 "report": "<p>So our friend is throwing a kickback at his house and all of my closest friends are gonna be there. I planned on popping some triple c's and smoking a little, but this was all before the idea of ecstasy was brought up. When my friend proposed the idea I was very excited, as I had never done it before, but always wanted to. 3 of my best friend were in, and we picked up from a very reliable source, so there were no worries there.</p><p>T 0:00 - Me and one of my friends got to the party a little early and were eager to get things started so we smoked a bowl, our mindset being it would wear off right before it was time to take the E.</p><p>T 1:30 - At EXACTLY 8:32 we all took our hit, nobody chewed, it was the first time for 3 of us and we all wanted the same experience.</p><p>T: 1:45 - All 4 of us are standing outside waiting for people to show up and 3 of the 4 of us are starting to get some effects, me included. I see a bug on the bricks by the light, stare at it for bout 10 minutes then a friend comes over to join me.  We decide to migrate to the back yard. I skip through the house to the beat of the amazing song by Jamiroquai, Canned Heat. </p><p>T: 2:15 - A fellow roller was smoking a cigarrete (2 of the rollers had chained smoked the entire night, not normal), when he points out an interesting philosophy, that life is like smoke and in how it dissipates but always returns in another form later.  This really had me pondering. Another roller was rocking vigerously in his chair as he was staring at the flame to his lighter, he was in his own realm. The third person just sat in his chair with a huge grin on his face.</p><p>T 2:30 - I decided to explore the house to see who had arrived, I turn the corner and saw the person I had wanted to see all night. When she said 'Hi' I replied 'whats up' nonchalantly, but I was really screaming of happiness inside.  She gave me a hug and my body tingled.  I told one of her friends that I was on E and she had done it before and said 'Hey watch this!' and she grabs my hand and begins to massage it. Sensory Overload. I had to run back out side, with a grin on my face of course. I noticed that everything had an erie, yet comforting haze to it, probably because my pupils were the size of pennies, and I didn't walk or run, I was gliding across the floor.</p><p>T 3:00 - Back outside with the other three rollers, and we are all reflecting out thoughts with each other.  It feels really good to talk and even better to listen.  Everything anyone said made perfect sense, and the next person would evolve on it.  My favorite quote of the night was 'I don't feel god-like, but I feel how god must feel'. Time to go swimming. The pool was heated to about 80/85 and was looking pretty good.  I get in and I feel every molecule of water send its electric charge to my skin cells.  Sensory Overload. Another girl walks out to go swimming, wearing booty shorts and a tank top. Sensory Overload. The pool vaccuum is making a loud click noise under water, which was making me very paranoid.</p><p>The pool got cold so I got out. I decided not to dry off because I was going in the spa in about 30 minutes and my mindset was that I didn't want to have a wet towel later so I had a seat around the table. My body was trembling when I sat down next to the girl I had wanted to see all night. Some herb was being passed around the table and I was happy to see people getting high, but I didn't smoke.  I had an intense conversation with the girl, then I got in the spa. Sensory Overload, got out.</p><p>T 4:00 - My brain was running in 6th gear and I needed to apply myself.  Me and my friends sat down to watch a Stephen Hawking film that had us all enthrawled and sparked out theoretical and mathmatical minds.</p><p>T 5:00 - The party had died down and after about an hour on conversing/dancing with people in the loud house I decided to go back to the quiet table.  Me and my friend smoked another bowl to calm our nerves and to help us sleep. My fellow rollers joined me in a philisophical discussion on life. We had come to the consensus that life was like a string, and MDMA plucked the string like a guitar. The guitar idea had sprout from the earlier display from another roller of his guitar skills, which had been amplified by the ecstasy. A static string was life in Equilibrium, where the vibrating string was life while rolling, or on any other drug for that matter. Captivated by this theory I was motivated to write down my thoughts. When I got a pen and paper I sat away from the chattery others and entered my own mathmatical realm. Scratching away at my paper, people walked by, confused, I couldn't wait to show them my theory. I got down about 6 pages of mathmatical proof and other tangents to the 'string theory'.  </p><p>T 6:00 - By the time I finished writing all this down everyone had gone inside. I skipped back inside to show my rolling friends what I had down. When I gave them the paper, I was worried about criticism, but they understood and agreed perfectly and we discussed this for another 2 hours.</p><p>T 11:00 - After a long night of deep discussion I thought it would be a good idea to get some sleep. As I lied down a cold feeling crept over me. Sadness, loneliness, fear, and irritability were just some of the emotions. I felt myself hit rock bottom of my come-down and it felt horrible. I finally got to sleep.</p><p>T 15:00 - All of the rollers woke up at about the same time, and we all had positive outlook on the night.  We sat around the living room reminiscing about the experience.  We all agreed that it was a life-altering experience, and we would be up for it again, but not for a while.</p>",
