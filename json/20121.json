 "report": [
  "[Erowid Note: While it may be that the substance described below is 2C-B, Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure or misrepresented, often containing chemicals other than those they are presumed to contain. This is more of a general Ecstasy report.] ",
  "My experience on 2C-B was one I will honestly never forget. It started out at the club that night, I had taken 2 tabs on an empty stomach at 9:30 pm. I rolled extremely hard all night until about 4 when I came down, and decided I needed one more to get me through the day without feeling terrible.",
  "At the time I really cared less about what I was getting, the guy was selling purple clubs and I assumed it was mescaline so I purchased it. The tab was a lighter purple, pretty thick and a little chalky. I took it at 6:30 and didnt begin to feel effects until the car ride home at 8 in the morning.",
  "I could tell I was tripping in the car. When my friend and I arrived back at the apartment I felt way better than I did leaving the club. I had an extreme energy boost even though I hadnt eaten in 12 hours or slept in 24. I felt like it was going to be a great day. My friend and I both took a bong hit and took a beer to the balcony to smoke a cigarette.",
  "Going outside set my trip way off, thats when the visuals began to kick in. Looking at the grass turning purple, I could see every blade grow, breathe, and swirl. I felt like I had microscopic vision, and was talking my friends ear off about the detail of the visuals I was having. I took a tiny sip of beer and an intense surge made my entire body spasm hard. I knew that was a mistake because the visuals had taken a stronger turn now. If I stared at anything for more than a few seconds my eyes began to burn and nothing looked familiar until I blinked. This is when I began to get scared of the intensity. I stood up and headed for the door quickly, and as soon as I opened the door the true of effects of this drug kicked in instantly.",
  "I looked in the mirror and my pupils were bigger than I had ever seen them in my life. The entire apartment looked as if someone had drawn it. I began to sweat profusely and immediately laid down on the couch. I started to panic because I did not know what drug I was on, and this was way more intense than any mescaline trip I ever had. I tried closing my eyes but the visuals were so much more intense than the open eye visuals. My friend watched in horror as I started to freak out. The drug had taken a dark turn in my head.",
  "I began peaking hard. My friend said my pupils were getting larger and smaller every second, and I was feeling the same thing in my ears. The entire time I felt extremely uncomfortable, no euphoria or enlightenment. For a long time I thought I was dying, and the visuals were very dark, but my friend would say something like youre alright man, and it helped lighten up the visuals. My body was extremely sensitive to yawns or popping my ears, both made me trip hard and I avoided them if possible. The more I wondered what I was on the more I freaked out, and I needed to know what I was tripping so hard on, so I contacted my good friend who was very into the tab business. I told her what I took and she was sad to say that it was 2C-B. This eased my mind because I couldnt help think I was on something ridiculous like crystal meth or just dying in general. At this point I was much more relaxed and tried to enjoy the hardcore hallucinations I was having.",
  "Listening to music wasnt anything special. Sounds were very distorted and not pleasant as they are on MDMA or 2C-E. The beat of the music changed the visuals somewhat like a music visualizer but it still sounded as it does sober. I had a hard time enjoying the experience as much as I tried, the drug is not nearly as glorious as 2C-E. I feel 2C-B is the drug for a talented artist. I can still remember all visuals I had and would paint everything I saw that day. The trip wore off around 6 that evening and I didnt stop having hallucinations for days after.",
  "Being an experienced LSD, Mescaline, and 2C-E user, this was still the most intense drug I have ever come across. Fortunately I was in a controlled environment while I freaked out for the majority of my trip. Overall I would not try this drug again, but I look back and laugh at the experience."
