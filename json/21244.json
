 "report": "<p>I am writing this as a precautionary word of advice for those who never have tried this drug.</p><p>People around my part use meth recreationally, it's pretty common among a certain, pretty large group of people, and shunned (or kept secret) by those more 'astute' drug users.</p><p>It's use recreationally however, is often in excess, and thanks to harm reduction efforts, this kind of use can be deterred.</p><p>Well anyway, I had done meth a few times prior to this experience, introduced to the drug by a friend. I had always used it in appropriate doses and had not had a problem with it. However, one day, I obtained an HG of what they call around here 'fire' or very pure dope in powdered form. I put it in a 'snuff bullet' and a started ripping, hanging out a friends house at first for several hours and became really disinterested in this, and moved on to go out to visit another friend. All of this was over a period of say 6 hours, and the whole time I just kept getting speedier and speedier doing more and more shots from the bullet. Now to anyone who's ever done coke before, they are used to the high lasting for a bout an hour usually, so they do several lines and it's not a big deal. But with meth, pure meth, that is, I do several lines and I'm jacked for at least 12 hrs. Well, before I knew it I had done close to a half-gram within 10 hrs. This might not sound like a ton, but it was really kicking my ass. I was flying and felt really good, super-human at first, as could be expected, but soon realized that I had overdone it. I stayed up for 3 days and wanted to eat very badly, just praying for this dope to wear off, finally when it did, I felt absolutely shitty.</p><p>I felt very weak and anemic and could barely eat because of lack of energy. This is when I realized how shitty powders, especially meth really can be.</p><p>From then on I don't need to fuck with this stuff. It can be tempting if I feel a little slothy, but Wheaties, and some multi-vitamins, work better for energy without the side effects.</p><p>Anyone considering trying this, nah, don't. Herbs and hallucinogens are so much more enjoyable and beneficial, that it seems nearly a sacrilege to compare marijuana and shrooms to meth.  Whereas, meth and coke make people have a sense of artificial super-humaness, and make already selfish people more selfish and anal, entheogens if used by the right people in the right context, can bring a beautiful realization and apprection of the more lovely things in the world. Meth is for people who have to stay up for weeks on end, not recreation.</p>",
