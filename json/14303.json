 "report": [
  "aka 'The time my homie disappeared with a head full of drugs on 4/20'",
  "B - MXE approximately 15mg, 25i nbome 2.5mg(first time), Several bowls of weed, several balloons of nitrous, 2ish beers",
  "Me - MXE 45mg, lot of weed, a brownie edible, lots of nitrous, 2 beers",
  "This report is done by a friend(me) of the tripper(B), and I ended up being the sitter as time drew on.",
  "A lot of this report is solely situational and reports only the trippers external behavior, but I thought this would be a good idea to report as a warning. Times are also mostly approximate",
  "11pm. B arrives at my house",
  "11:15. B insufflates approximately 15mg of Mxe (eyeballed), I have about 30mg as I have a bit of a tolerance. Then we smoke a fat bowl and head off to an underground across town.",
  "Midnight. We finally get to the u.g. and get inside. The venue is 2 main rooms. The first room, they collected entrance fees and performed subpar searches before letting people through the hallway into the 2nd room. We get into the 2nd room. The stage is on the other side of the room. Then 15 minutes later B eats 2 and a half blotters, each containing 1 mg of 25i. We smoke a bowl, and I head to my real goal, the nitrous tanks. B and I do several whippets, and enjoy a cigarette.",
  "1am. B starts feeling the 25i, buys a pressy and eats it. B seems to be having a thoroughly good time. B is dancing and feeling the music, much more so than I've ever seen this him do before. B is the kinda guy I've seen rolling so hard, he'd be walking around talking to girls while pullin the t-rex. He'd literally be walking around with his arms pulled back and with his hands curved like dinosaur claw. Somehow while doing this he'd still be pulling girls. (LOL) We continue to do whippets while he starts to peak on the 25i and really feeling the pill.",
  "2am. B seems very fucked up, dancing and occasionally getting out of control and running into a dancer or 2. It was super packed inside the little venue, lots of cramped, sweaty, fucked up people. I remain mostly sober aside from the nitrous, weed, and a few beers.",
  "3am. I start giving light shows since the crowd seems to be getting a little smaller at least (need room to spin god damn it). I let B mess with my poi as he used to do it over a year ago. He was doing really well for how long it had been.",
  "3:30am. B starts dancing way all over the place running into more kids, treating the dance floor like a moshpit. Then, runs straight into a smaller girl and she gets knocked over. Her boyfriend gets pretty angry but sees how hard B is tripping, so I tell them he'll chill out and we go to the 1st room, where it was cooler and there were plenty of couches to relax on.",
  "4am. B starts closing his eyes a lot, laying down on a couch. I make sure to watch him and occasionally try to make him lay on his side in case he throws up. He never really stays on his side for long at this point tho. He seems to be going up and down from being able to give cognitive responses, so some the other raver kids tell the medic about B. The medic comes by and starts talking to me, checks his pulse, etc. He seemed like he really knew what he was doing and he gave me a brownie edible to chill me out. B continues in and out of reality, but mostly he seemed to be in good spirits, just really fucked up, obviously getting heavy visuals at this point and working through some stresses in his head. He was like this (going up and down) for a good hour and a half, then, seemed to miraculously feel much better and have energy again. I convinced him to go into the 2nd room by the stage to get a lightshow after I let him play with my poi and he seemed to have a great time dancing and having fun for another 45 minutes.",
  "6:15. I go to take a piss, get out and can't find B anywhere in the venue. The kids in the first room tell me that he went outside, so I run outside to find B a block away, lost, looking for the car. I ask him what he's doing. The medic suggested we should stay until the music stops, and at least sleep for a couple hours in the car before we drive. B really wanted to drive. I asked him a good 20x if he was really ok to drive, and he kept saying 'yes, yes, yes.' I finally gave in and let him drive us back. Worst idea ever, most terrifying 20 mile drive of my life. B seemed to love it, though.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
  "7am. We finally get back to my house. Now this is when shit gets really weird! I pack a bowl hit it and pass it, immediately after B hits the bowl he starts hitting it over and over till it was dead, I'm pretty sure he hit it so hard it shit on him. B starts going back into a presumably deep state within his mind and being unresponsive. Doing things such as going into what seemed like deep trances, staring at my bedroom ceiling, while spinning in circles, running into shit in my room and creating a huge fucking mess. He had no idea at the time, either. Every once in a while I'd yell at him to regain his senses and tell him to sit down and calm down. He would listen for about 5 minutes at best. Over the whole night I tried to keep him talking, got him talking about some philosophy for a moment, but no matter what I did I could not get him to stay focused.",
  "8am. Shortly after 8 rolled around, I was watching South Park, trying to wait off his trip. Out of nowhere, while sitting on MY bed, B started to take his pants off, then undies. Then starts playing with himself. Once I notice what he's doing I start yelling at him. 'What are you doing?!? Put your clothes on!!' I had to tell him this a good 5 times before he snapped out of it and started putting his clothes back on. I was about to kick him out of my house right then, but I knew if he left he'd be jail, hospitalized, or worse dead. He returned to going in and out his trances, doing almost ritualistic like dancing and deep staring into my walls, lost.",
  "10am. I tried to stay up as long as possible to make sure he didn't fuck up my room, leave, or do anything stupid; but this is about when I crashed.",
  "10:30. According to my roommate this is when B left. Leaving his keys, shoes, and phone.",
  "1pm. I wake up and find no B.",
  "I decided to make this report because I thought the high dose of 25i, or the combination of any of the substances done may have all been a part of all B's strange behavior. B seemed to act rather impulsively all night, which I seem to notice with a lot of people on 25i. He's a nice guy for the most part, but acted flat off rude for most of the night, and never apologized to the girl (that he knocked over). I think everyone should exercise caution while trying strong doses of 25i and mixing it with other substances, especially mxe, (god knows what was in that pill), and maybe even nitrous."
