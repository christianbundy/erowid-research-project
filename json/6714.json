 "report": [
  "Background: I have done most hallucinogens out there. Malloy has done mushrooms many times, Salvia, 4-HO-DiPT, and acid once. Beberno and Wosk have both done acid shrooms and salvia as well. This is going to be the second time Malloy and I try 5-Me0-DALT.",
  "Setting and Dose: Each of my friends Wosk, Beberno, Malloy, and myself (CactusHead] took capsules containing between 50-70 mgs of 5-MeO-DALT per capsule. Malloy and I took the smaller capsules, while Beberno and Wosk took the larger two. We had all eaten about an hour and a half ago, and our food wasn't completely digested yet. This is the second time that Malloy and I have done this (were doubling our dosage this time) while Wosk and Beberno are trying this for their first time. I hope all goes well for the night. Were hanging out in my apartment and were planning on watching a DJ Shadow DVD later. Beberno has had several beers tonight.",
  "0:00 - We all take our capsules.",
  "0:40 - Im starting to feel it. Im noticing slight euphoria. Beberno says that hes feeling something as well.",
  "0:50 - We put on a DJ Shadow DVD. I am noticing word movement on the computer screen.",
  "1:10 - Wosk and I both took some unknown amount more. Were all feeling a body high and a slight euphoria.",
  " 1:25 - We just saw the Saturday Secret Stash on Comedy Central, featuring Adam Sandlers new video, Secret. Beberno and Malloy joke that it nearly ruined their trips.",
  "1:40 - Wask and I ate an unknown amount more. (The next day I found that Wosk and I ingested a total of 100-120mgs throughout the night, while Beberno and Malloy ingested roughly 60mgs.) I have a good amount of energy and I decide to dance for awhile. This energy is somewhat comparable to a small dose of ecstasy.",
  "2:20  [Bakers notes]: Lots of energy. In a good mood. Warm.",
  "2:30 - I feel very loose, very jello-like. Definitely in a good mood, getting a lot of trails and some color shifting and transparent colored images around me. My body feels really good, in some ways a buzz similar to a mild dose of ecstasy. Running my hand through my hair feels good because my skin feels slightly tingly and electric. Oh yeah, music is fucking awesome. The visuals are directly influenced by the music, and the music shapes the body high. The experience is not that of synethesia, but the body high, visuals, and music all create this singular experience; they are connected at a fundamental and intimate level. Wosk happily announces that hes tripping. We are both in a great mood, and are telling jokes and laughing. While we cannot clearly express ourselves all the time, but we still feel a sense of empathetic and understood. This is another characteristic that is somewhat like a small dose of ecstasy.",
  "3:10  This is very trippy. My thoughts seem pretty clear, but I also feel slightly paranoid. I am not particularly enjoying the body high anymore. A strong buzz is going through my body, and I feel like my neck is very tense. I think of the article I read about someone that took too much of a research chemical (I think 2C-T-7) and developed lumps that moved through his neck. These thoughts disturb me slightly. I feel tension throughout my body. However, I dont know how much of this is being produced by the Fear.",
  "3:20 [Bakers notes]: Beberno and I smoked some pot about a half hour ago. Feel almost drunk, but clear headed. Still high energy and mood.",
  "4:20 - I had an uncomfortable body high for awhile a strange tension throughout my head and neck. I am feeling much better now though, and slight Fear from earlier is now gone. This substance is interesting.",
  "4:50- Definitely not tripping as hard. However, there are still good visuals. My body feels much calmer now though, and I feel more sober mentally. There are still good visuals though. The visuals are not really like acid or mushrooms. Carpets, tiles, and tapestries all move in a fashion that is similar to MDMA, however, the visuals are more interesting than just this. They are also accompanied by very long trails, and long lasting ghost images. Also, I can sometimes see an image of my thoughts superimposed onto whatever Im looking at. Very good substance. Mentally it is slightly trippy, but certainly not psychedelic. It is actually very easy on the mind, even when negative thoughts are present. ",
  "Summary of 5-Me0-DALT: The trip seems to bloom in several stages. It starts with a positive mood, accompanied with energy. Eventually this chemical develops into a state where thoughts, visuals, energy, emotions, and music become one. In the final stage, there are no longer emotional or physical effects, just visual.",
  "-Body High was energetic, somewhat sensual, and sometimes slightly uncomfortable.",
  "-Mental Experience was always clear-headed, usually positive, and somewhat empathetic.",
  " -Emotional Experience was usually positive, and occasionally neutral. There were brief points of slight dysphoria.",
  "-Visuals consisted of MDMA-like wavy/blurring effects, long trails, and lots of ghost images. There are often subtle open-eye images that I can only compare to mescaline, but quite milder.",
  "While there was an uncomfortable part of this trip, it never became confusing, frightening, or overwhelming. There were also no alarming physical reactions. This would likely be a good chemical for first-time trippers. If I could take an MDMA experience and make it less physically stimulating, less emotionally stimulating, but more visually stimulating, then it would be like a 5-Me0-DALT experience.",
  "I also want to briefly note that the first two times I tried this I did not experience any nausea. However, the 3rd time I tried this chemical I spent about half the trip with moderate nausea, but no vomiting. It is possible that this is attributed to several sips of beer."
