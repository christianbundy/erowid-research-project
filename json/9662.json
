 "report": "<p>My mom and dad told me they were going out of town for the night, so I was thinking what I could do that would probably be considered illegal. I had no LSD or Shrooms, very small amount of weed, and a few Adderall. Well what to do, what to do? I decided to try DXM for the third time, but this time I wanted to have real hallucinations so I decided to try 8oz instead of four. Well now with my mind set on hallucinating, I went outside and got on my bike to go pedal to the store, but it was way to damn hot for that. So I go back in my room disappointed and start looking through my backpack my sister took on a trip she went on, and to my delighted surprise I found some Dramamine (she gets mad motion sickness). So I open up my browser, search the web a bit, get some info, and finally decide to pop the ten pills that were left over in this tube.</p><p>I put five pills in my mouth first (they are kinda small, but I hate taking a lot of pills at once) and they were mad gross, but I swallowed it with water and took the other five pills. I logged onto AOL instant messenger and talked to my friend for awhile, it was around 4:00 pm when I took the pills.</p><p>About an hour later I started getting real bad cotton mouth, and I was starting to make less and less sense online. I got up to get some water and when I was walking down the hall looking at my feet, every step I took had this semi transparent whitish glow around it. I was like...that's kinda cool. Got my water, went to the bathroom, and came back. By this time I was getting real tired, and I just kept telling myself to stay awake or I'll just sleep through the trip. I had some nice melodic music on, nothing to hard or to soft, and just listened. By this time I was talking about completely random stuff online and I would get really confused and frustrated, forget what I was talking about to people, and finally I just logged off. I went over to my bed and started laying down, closing my eyes. I kept telling myself I wasn't going to sleep, just going to listen to the rest of this song...Finally I told myself I would fall asleep if I kept this up. I turned over and opened my eyes. In my room there is a giant flag of Che Guevara hung over my window. Well call me crazy, but I saw his lips moving up and down really rapidly. It wasn't natural lip movement when talking, but rather it looked like a robot moving his lips up and down. I didn't hear anything coming from them, and I was like...dude that's weird. So I closed my eyes for a second, and when I opened them it was gone.</p><p>I got up to go back to my computer and read some trip reports on this shit, and when I got to the computer, I would open up my favorites, then be like...what was I looking for? Then I clicked the link to a message board I most often visit. I would feel like this wasn't what I wanted to do, then Id close down my browser and try again. Finally I got to some trip reports and started reading, but after about two sentences I would forget what I was reading about, and try and start over. I kept thinking to myself, this must be what the guy in Memento would feel like.</p><p>Ok, time to check up on my dogs. CRAP they got out of the backyard. Well now I gotta go look for them. I went into the front yard, and yelled out my dogs name. Well it didn't come out very well, and I was kinda like...ugh. So I started walking, it was a little past dark now, and I kept seeing these shapes of my dog (which is a Chihuahua) running around. I'd run up to them, then realise they werent the dog. Finally I gave up and decided that the dog would come back home. I went back into my backyard, and luckily I heard scratching at the door. I opened it and my dog ran in, yay.</p><p>By now I was really tired, it was about 4 hours after I took the pills. So I brought my dogs into my house and let them run around, and went into my room. I looked at my bed and swear I saw an elf dancing on my bed. It had no real color, but it was kinda greyish clear, and it just danced on my bed. I was like...what the hell is that? So I walked up to it and put my hand on it, but it just disappeared. I fell into my bed and closed my eyes. At this point I think I passed out, but I had some weird dreams.</p><p>One I remember was I was running down this hallway with portraits hanging on the wall with everyone I have ever met in my life talking to me, telling my advice on life. I don't remember what they said, but I remember specifically that's what the subject was - advice on life.</p><p>I woke up about 6 hours into the trip, and opened my eyes. Nothing. Not even those little squares I was seeing on the wall that were that greyish clear color. Lame.</p><p>I went back to bed and woke up again at 4 am. Got some water (my mouth was really dry) and laid in bed for awhile. Finally got back to sleep and woke up again at 9 am. No hangover at all.</p><p>Conclusion: Weird experience. Not much fun, not very boring either. Plan on trying it again, but this time with 12 pills, maybe more. Also plan on having a cup of coffee, or taking an Adderall (A.D.D. Stimulant) before I take the pills.</p>",
