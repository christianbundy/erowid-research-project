 "report": "<p>This was my third of fourth experience with ether. The most extreme hallucination before this point was the overwhelming sense of deja vu. The 8 of us were in my backyard sitting in a circle passing the rag around between 3 or 4 of the group. I had hit the rag at least 10 times, although I'm very unsure of the dose. At first I just got the usual sound hallucinations (wawawawawa) and goofy euphoria but then when the guy next to me to my right laughed the top part of his head (from the corner of his mouth and up) fell back and was pulled away when a dotted line, much like the 'cut here' line in coloring books, started from the corner of his mouth and reached horizantally around the rest of my frontal view. This caused everthing I was looking at (in front of me) to become 2-d, it was like I was looking at a photograph. Then scissors follwed the line and cut along it. The top section was pulled up and away and disappeared from my view. Essentially everyone's heads had been cut off. Behind where the piece had been cut away was a 3-d space but it was simply white and light.</p><p>I rapidly came aware of the knowledge that I had died 3 days prior to the experience but that this was the normal cycle everyone goes through after they die. At this point I slipped into my mind and began seeing  anifestations of death (the concept not the figure) and its spiral-like cycle. I was contemplating how I was dead and the fact that it was cyclical like the reign of chinese empires, when the guy sitting next to me eventually asked if I was ok. Before this I had become unaware of the fact that the people around me, or what i could see of them, were living. I had stopped hearing anything that was going on. I have no idea how long I had been like this. I turned to look at him and touched his leg. The feel of the denim on my hand was the most intense tactile sensation I had ever felt and it brought me back to reality. There were very little effects left after I came to. In fact within 5 or 10 minutes I was fine. Considering the reverse tolerance of ether, I considered this my last experience with it and i have stuck to that.</p>",
