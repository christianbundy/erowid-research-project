 "report": "<p>An online buddy of mine in a different state was curious as to whether or not coleus was active as well.  So I brought some coleus home and let it grow out for a week or two.  It has such bright foliage with bright reds and pinks with yellow and green edges. </p><p>So one night, an hour before bed, I picked one huge leaf.  The leaf was about 6 inches long and 4-5 inches wide with lots of dark red on it.  At first, I chewed a very small piece off and swallowed it.  I wanted to be cautious, for if this plant was poisonous or harmful, I didnt want to ingest a large amount and screw myself over.</p><p> I let 20 minutes pass and finish the rest of the leaf.  Nothing happened for about 40 minutes (t+1hr).  So I decided to get to bed, hoping that I would get some effect even if its only through dream state.</p><p>That night I had the most vivid dream of my life, which is a lot to say, being is that I lucid dream very often at will, and those dreams were not as real as this one was. </p><p>I dreamed that it was the future, at least 2089, but I was the age I am now.  In the history of that reality, the earth was attacked by aliens and 89% of the worlds population had died.  Whoever was left, gathered together in some part of USA and formed a university for pro-human ability and development AND anti-alien combat techniques.  I went to this school and had several buddies.</p><p>The next day after I woke, I didnt feel sick or anything negative.  Just highly refreshed from my mental vacation that night.   .</p><p>I told my online buddy that I had a powerful dream, but I never said what it entailed.  And last week, he ate some coleus and had almost the exact same dream.  The future, a university, something terrible in the recent past....</p><p>I dont know if these dreams were derived from our expectations, but Im open to the fact that entheogens can have qualities beyond my comprehension.</p>",
