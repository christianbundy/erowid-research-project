 "report": [
  "T: -2 Months:  Pre-load of Bupropion 300mg/day and Trazodone 200mg per/night for 60 days.",
  "T: -18 hours: Trazodone 200mg.",
  "T: -9 hours: Bupropion 300mg.",
  "After 2 months on the Trazodone/Bupropion regime I am energetic, sleeping well, and experiencing a very pleasant sense of well-being during the day, accompanied by mild and pleasant body sensations on my arms and legs.  I decided that I wanted a new stimulant type drug because of some memory effects of the Trazodone.  After much research into anti-depressants and their effects/side effects profile, I found Reboxetine and ordered 60 4mg tablets.",
  "T: 0  I take 8mg of Reboxetine orally and sit down to eat.  I am anticipating something, but I don't know what.",
  "T: +15 minutes:  Suddenly the lights appear very bright, as if the sun is shining over the dinner table.  I am startled; everything has that 'glassy look' as in the first few minutes of a strong LSD trip.",
  "T: +20 minutes:  The glassy appearance and brightness are fading when suddenly a delightful rush of shivers, similar to a mild methamphetamine rush, flows down my head and over my arms and legs.  I also am experiencing mild euphoria and enjoying an orgasmic like feeling in the palms of my hands.  I feel like talking, and I 'like everyone.'  My heart is pounding, and my face feels flushed.  The 'glow' of physical feeling and empathy ebbs and flows, mild euphoria and rushes rising up and down like waves beating on my mind. This continues, and at T+1 hours I take an additional 4mg of Reboxetine.",
  "T: +1 to +7 hours.  The experience doesn't develop stronger but it changes in quality.  The effects experienced in the first hour plateau, and the empathy and euphoria depart at about T +2 hours.  The physical sensations become milder and milder over until the last of them at about T+7.  I feel like I want to do something; energetic and mind racing, so I chat with some Chinese girls on the internet. I am very, very horny and making obvious sexual advances to some of my friends, asking if they want to go and spend a weekend with me on Easter Island, etc.  I have a driving feeling of wanting to do something; however I am constrained in this setting (mother's house) so I lay on the bed and listen to music. ",
  "T: +7 to +9 hours: I take 200mg of Trazodone and spend the next 2 hours drifting in and out of a dreamy, trance-like state.  The body sensations have become similar to the chills felt when coming down from amphetamine. My head has a slight ache, and I fall asleep.",
  "T: +14 hours:  I wake up, feeling energetic and alert.  I doze off for another hour,wake up, take 300mg bupropion and 8 mgs of Reboxetine, and the cycle begins again.  I will continue this regime of anti-depressants for another 1 to 2 months, and observe long-term effects and side effects.",
  "Other observations:  The feeling in the first 3 to 4 hours was very similar to Preludin (Phenmetrazine.) In the first 3 hours I also experienced time dilation; time seemed to rush by, but when I looked at the clock, only 10 or 15 minutes had passed.  There was also some mild anxiety and agitation when the waves were on the downside but not serious enough to be a concern.  The last few hours with the headaches and chills was similar to what I experienced on Ionamin (phentermine.)  The dreamy state was induced by the Trazodone; however, it was more ethereal with the additional effects of the Reboxetine.  Overall, this was an A+ experience with few bad effects.  I believe I could easily work in this state, or engage in other complex activities.  I have ordered an additional 180 4mg tablets from an online pharmacy and will continue this research."
