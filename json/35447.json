 "report": "<p>I'm a healthy 22 year old male with a fairly broad experience and deep respect for all things mycological (I just plain love shrooms!) I've tried three varieties of australian psylocibic mushrooms and also amanitas, and thought that I had seen all that the area had to offer in terms of fungal entheogens.  Not so.  My friends came to me one day, with the healthy glow that is apparent after any shrooming, and told me of a strange creature called a philosopher's stone, a truffle if you would.</p><p>Curiosity prompted me to hit the net and do a little research.  Growing mushrooms is apparently common place in the rest of the world, but in australia cow paddocks are so plentiful and the weather quite favourable for cubensis developement for often as long as four/five months of the year, and amanitas are available in autumn and the onset of winter.  There's just no need to grow them.  A Philosopher's stone is apparently a dormant form of psylocibe mexicana and the truffle, which is scientifically called a scleriole, is more potent than a fruiting body.  I was intrigued and quickly aqquired some of this precious fruit, about 7-10g sold in a small container.</p><p>I'm a fairly experienced tripper so I thought that I'd fast for a few hours before my trip.  This turned out later to not have been long enough, or my digestion was impaired.  I prepared a weak tea of passionflower, maybe 5g.  I don't think this would have contributed much to the trip intensity but don't mind the taste and a v.weak maoi couldn't hurt.  I also had a small toke of cannabis to get me feeling a little mellow, something that I find always helps at the start of a trip.  Cannabis has excellent synergy with most tryptamines and it's helpful for those who hate the taste of mushroom as it takes away most of the nausea.  I prepared the fruity smelling powder (I assume it had been ground) in a chai tea, and began to drink the vile brew.  It's not as bad as a lot of things I've drunk but still gag-able. </p><p>I was suprised to hear a knock at the door.  My buddy G and his mates had rocked up looking to swap some grass for an e, and to see if I wanted to go out that night.  I explained to them what I had just taken and they were all a little apprehsive about shrooms themselves but seemed intrigued and began to put the pressure on me to go out clubbing.  I was a bit intrepid, having a respect for all things hallucinogenic, especially untried ones, but as I began to feel that nervous excitement that is common in the onset of most drugs, I found myself getting dressed, rolling a joint and hitting the town.</p><p>As I started to come on I began to remember why I liked mushrooms so much.  Though I was headed out into a public place I wasn't nervous, there was no danger of me getting into any trouble while I was with so many of my friends who at that stage I was beggining to bond with strongly.  They all appeared beautifically serene, though I later was told they were all totally drunk, rowdy and possibly on any other assortment of chems.</p><p>Tracers had begun at that point and the ride into town was like a kaleidascope of colour, movement and sound, bouncing along to a primal beat that only intensified as we entered the night club.  At this stage the intensity of the shrooms went through the roof and I was dancing and flying round the room on the backs of the lasers shooting out of the ceiling.  There was an excellent dj playing tripped-out dance and house and almost everyone was there on the dance floor.  At the risk of being labelled excessive I thought that now was the perfect time to take X.  I had candy flipped before but only ever with lsd, never mushrooms, which I infinitely prefer. </p><p>That may have been a slight mistake.  I got a little nautious but that quickly passed after one of the hugest and most amazing spews I have ever had, quite disproportionate to the amount of food I had eaten.  Not essentially painful but intensly visual.  If I tried to close my eyes as I was throwing up I would immediately be transported somewhere else, a room in my head of psychadelics.</p><p>The bass of the club was like a living thing and as the x came on the walls of the toilet shimmered and turned to obsidian.  Phantasmal medicine women came leaning out of the walls and stroked my hair and told me that I would be alright and not to be upset.  A dog made of black glass popped out of the floor and wagged its tail.  Its lolling tongue made me realise I was no longer feeling sick to my stomach.</p><p>The toilet bowl was a distant memory as I floated to the washbasins and cleaned my mouth out.  My reflection appraised me in a manner most unhumanlike.  It seemed fairly satisfied with my appearance and let me leave the bathroom into the throbbing womb of the nightclub dance floor.  I began to let the music take me and lost time and space in the throb of the kick drum.  Life was good.  Complex themes slipped into the primordial and all those around me were dancing and spinning in the swirling vortex of life.  Appreciation of others was profound, much greater than simple X empathy, rather a greater understanding of that person on a spiritual level.  I've had a similar sort of experience with 2c-b and x. </p><p>I'll leave it there and say that it was one of the best mushroom trips I've ever had.  My minor freakout was quickly dealt with and I'm sort of proud to have been tripping that hard in a public area with minimal paranoia.  The hallucinations that I had from the philosopher's stone were great though not as strong as some of the cubensis trips I've had.  However in comparison with the fungal material I ate and the physical sensation one sometimes gets with fresh mushroom, like getting poisoned, occasionally, was completely absent.  I'm pretty sure the spew was MDMA related.  My poor stomach was no doubt shrunk to the size of a peanut. </p><p>The whole experienced lasted with me dosing at around 22:00 and reaching a tentative baseline, which I knocked on the head with a joint and a valium, at around 06:00 the next day. This will go down as one of my best drug experiences to date.  I make no pretence of looking for spirituality on this occasion.  It was pure fun.</p>",
