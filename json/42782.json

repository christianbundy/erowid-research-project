See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.] </p><p>It was the first time I'd ever done it and I was looking for a quick high. I was at my friends house and we went to the store where I bought a box of Corcidin HBP. We got back to her house and I sat in the recliner and downed 10 tablets in 2 sets of 5. I sat in the chair for like an hour and didn't feel anything so I decided to leave. I got up and could feel the medicine just drop in my system. It felt like all the blood in my head just fell to my feet.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>I didn't think anything of it and got in my car and drove home. By the time I got 2/3 of the way home I was so fucked up I could barely drive. I had this dizzy feeling like I was about to pass out. I got home and layed on the couch and had this feeling of dizziness. It felt like the whole room was spinning and after an hour I fell asleep. Well I woke up about 2 hours later only to find I was still on the DXM trip. I got up and felt cold and my whole body was numb. I put my hand to my chest and couldn't even feel my heart beating.</p><p>I thought I was dead or about to die so I got in the shower and had the water on as cold as it could get. I stood in there for about 10 minutes to shock myself awake and about that time 2 of my friends came over. I got out of the shower and walked in the living room and all I could remember was them both looking at me and telling me how white I was and how sick I looked. I felt terrible. I ended up sitting in the living room and eating something, then we went and walked around the block and I felt fine after we walked. I wouldn't recommend the Corcidin but I'm going to try other ones that have DXM as the only active ingredient.</p>",
