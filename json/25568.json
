 "report": "</p>\n[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>Cocaine, where do I start? Well, I'll start with saying that I have tryed a bunch of different drugs.  I've smoked herb, taken speed before, and smoked opium from time to time with some friends.  But nothing was quite like Coke. </p><p>Just from hearing the word Coke, it didn't sound that great. I mean, after hearing all the horror stories about it, it didn't really scream 'SNORT ME'.  I did wanna try it though, and trying it was one of the best things I've done in a while.  As far as drugs go.</p><p>When they came up on Coke, I was sorta scared to do it to tell the truth...I knew how addicting it was, and I really didnt wanna make a habit outta it.  So, I watched them take a few lines of their own, and then I realized, that I should juss try it.  So I did.  I set up a long thin line, just to try...took the $5 rolled up, and snorted.  It was the greatest feeling ever.  It totally cleared up my nostrils.  It felt so clean and refreshed.  I liked it right off the bat.  But anyways, I took about 2 more, and took the excess coke and put it on my gums and teeth.  I was basically told it would all go numb. </p><p>We then went outside for a smoke, and it really felt great.  We were talkin, bout deep shit, stuff that had happened, and it felt good as hell. I really enjoyed Coke, and I can see why so many people had coke problems. Within moments....my whole mouth was numb and I felt great.  I could even drive on it, it felt so good, a relaxed state, but I still felt hyped up, like I wanted to talk to someone, or go do something.  Anyways, it was a good experience, the only bad part was the drip.  See, when I snort coke, it goes up my nose and drips in the back of my throat, so eventually I get a nasty bitter taste in my mouth.  It's pretty gross, and eating anything that would normally be good, tastes like shit.  It basically takes my appetite away, but I would do it again.</p>",
