 "report": [
  "I received 500mg of 6-APB from a reputable vendor.  The material was a light tan powder that was very fine.  It was not crystalline at all.  The 500mg was so fluffy that it looked like a gram of other powders such as MDMA or cocaine.  About 5mg was tested on the day of receipt to test for any allergies.  No effects were noted.",
  "The next night three friends and I decided to each try 100mg. All of us have had experience with LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA.  All of us but the one female have had experience with MDA, ketamine, mxe and many different research phenethylamines and tryptamines.  We are all regular marijuana smokers.  All of us are in good health except for me.  I have Crohn's Disease which has not been bad the last couple years or so outside the occasional week-long flare up.  For those that do not know, it is an auto-immune disease that affects the intestines and colon and causes nausea and pain. I was feeling lightly nauseous before taking the 6-apb and knew I was probably in for a little stomach discomfort as I usually do have some with most phenethylamines.",
  "At 10:00 pm we all dose 100mg of 6-APB.  Two of my friends eat the powder while me and my other friend put ours in a capsule and take.",
  "T+:30  I start to feel the first alerts. Lights are a bit brighter and I start to feel the well-known feeling of a MDxx come up. We all decided now is a good time to smoke some marijuana.  I pack a couple bowls and it seems to helps bring on the effects.",
  "T+:50 All of us are now starting to fully feel the effects of the 6-APB.  Those who ate the straight powder are predictably feeling it more pronounced that those who took it in capsules.  I start to feel a bit nauseous but nothing overwhelming.  I smoke a bit more marijuana to calm my stomach and it seems to help.  The effects continued to build for the next 30-45 minutes.  This was a very gradual building in effects for all but one of us (one of those who ate powder straight on an empty stomach), much more like methylone than MDMA.  MDMA always has a very sudden and often jarring come up for me.  The 6-APB was much smoother besides the worsening nausea I was experiencing.",
  "T+1:30 We are all peaking now.  It comes in waves, a definite rolling feeling.  Everyone is just laying around with no motivation to move.  Conversation comes and goes as the waves come and go.  When the more intense waves of euphoria come no one says a word.  I am very nauseous now.  I try to vomit a couple times but am unable to.  As the more pronounced waves come the nausea becomes worse.  Everyone else is feeling amazing with no negative side effects.  I completely attribute this nausea to my Crohn's.  After a while I decide to go lay in my bed for a little bit until I feel better.",
  "T+2:00 I am now laying down in bed in my room with no lights. Everyone else is in the living room outside my room.  I carry on  conversation from time to time and start to feel better especially after they put some more relaxed music than the dubstep they were playing which I do not really care for.",
  "T+2:45 I am feeling great now.  No nausea to speak of.  I am still feeling the great MDx body feel while the visual aspect becomes much more pronounced.  The closed eye visuals are made up of bright colored neon lines bending and intertwining.  Opened eyes I get the breathing and shifting shadows I get from MDA and traditional psychedelics.  I join my friends in the living room and they too are starting to get more visuals. The headspace becomes more psychedelic in nature but still a lot of euphoria.  We start having some hilarious conversations.  We all went to high school together and don't see each other all the time so we told a lot of funny stories from that period of time.  The 6-APB seemed to really help bring back some funny memories that I had somewhat forgotten about.  Many bowls are passed around.  I want to smoke a lot of marijuana when tripping or rolling and this was no different.  The effects  plateau and slowly come down over the next hour and a half or so.",
  "T+4:30 We are all still feeling good but are much more functional now.  I decide that I would like to see how MXE combines with 6-APB.  I have had amazing times with MXE on the tail end of an LSD trip as well as ketamine on the tail end of LSD or MDMA so I figured it might be a worth while combo.     I insufflate 50mg in two 25mg lines spaced about 15 minutes apart.  I am amazed to find that the first line gave me a rush, something that MXE never does on its own.",
  "T+5:00 I am really feeling the MXE now.  It has brought back the feeling of the 6-APB and added a more psychedelic aspect to it.  I have some very interesting closed eye visuals.  I am overwhelmed by intense euphoria and can only lay down and bask in it. ",
  "After a little while I reached what most people call a hole.  It usually takes me close to twice the amount to get close to this level but it was noticeably different at even that dose.  There was definitely a synergistic effect that was very interesting and welcomed.  It was almost like I was lucid dreaming in that I could control my CEVs and create what I wanted to see.  It felt like just a taste of what it would be to be like a god.",
  "T+6:15 Everyone else is ready to go to sleep.  I am still feeling amazing and not ready to go to sleep.  I do another 10mg bump of MXE and go into my room so they can all get to sleep.  Everyone but me was asleep by T+7:00.  I go lay down in bed and put on a documentary about Ketamine.  I don't really pay attention and just lay there with my eyes closed as I feel the last bumps come and go.",
  "T+7:15 I have come down from the MXE for the most part and am left with an amazing afterglow feeling.  I decide that it is about time for sleep and turn off the TV.  I am asleep by T+8:00 without much difficulty.  Getting to sleep by 6:00am after dosing at 10:00pm and combining with MXE is not bad at all in my opinion.",
  "Overall I think 6-APB is a fine chemical.  I would definitely compare it to MDA but a bit less intense.  It came on incredibly smooth and didn't really have much of a crash to speak of.  I felt fine the next day, just a bit tired.  I did not have that stupid feeling I have often the day after MDMA or MDA.  Besides the nausea I had which I attribute to my Crohn's flaring up recently I had an amazing time.  Everyone else all agreed.  I could see myself dosing it a bit higher next time but I didn't notice a compulsion to redose like I do with MDMA.  I think 125mg might be my sweet spot and will test that dose next time and not dose when I am having a flare up."
