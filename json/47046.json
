 "report": "<p>2 ml of .5 mg bromo / ml %40 ethanol was diluted in 8 ml of water to create a 100 ug / ml solution. Product was shared between 4 people; one 120-pound female at one 100 ug dose, and the other three (males, 115-140 pounds) at 300 ug doses (100 ug dose every 3 hours from initial dose).</p><p>T+0 - First dose.</p><p>T+3h - No effects noticed yet, second dose is taken.</p><p>T+4h - Still no effects; 24 oz. of 5.5% ABV Bud Light is consumed over the period of an hour.</p><p>T+6h - Last dose is taken...mild confusion, brighter colors are noticed. Slight stimulation begins to take hold.</p><p>T+12h - Still awake, very light visual activity (warping, tracers, etc.) is apparent.</p><p>T+18h - Approximately 4 grams of mid-grade cannabis is smoked between the three 300 ug-dosed subjects.</p><p>T+19h - I begin sweating and my skin becomes very clammy. Heavy visual activity at approximately Level IV intensity; patterning begins pushing through the walls of the house and morphing, while green vines flow between them.</p><p>T+29h - Visual effects begin degrading, stimulatory effects have now recessed.</p><p>Extreme nausea was experienced for 48 hours after ingestion; also, severe vaso-constriction was imminent (but no lasting vascular effects have been noted). Very light visual activity through most of the experience...onset and peak were unpredictable. I recommend avoiding bromo dragonfly and would suggest 2-CB instead, which has a much more predictable timetable and much more intense visual activity.</p>",
