 "report": "<p>The other night i took 20mg of 2c-i at a psytrance party.  i had taken it a couple times before and found it to be like a kind of more relaxing acid.</p><p>The trip began with my usual huge excess of energy.  i was having alot of trouble figuring out the correct application of all this energy i was feeling (how to dance correctly so my body would would feel good) usually when i get too caught up in trying to relax i just say the hell with it, and dance as crazy and energetically as i can.  this time i really decided i wanted to feel good though, so i got caught in a major twist, trying as hard as I can to relax doesn't work very good ;)</p><p>So i sat down to try and figure this out and i ended up identifying somewhere bettween 3-5 completely differnt versions of myself each with thier own energetic pattern.   i did my best to force myself into the core indentity, this failed miserably and i would watch my differnt selves shift to the surface at high speed.  at this point i felt like i completely didn't understand anything, the best i could do was just focus on what my body was doing and make sure i was walking correctly, not moving stuff over ect.</p><p>as this continued further and further i figured i should be trying to resolve this while dancing.   this resulted in severe muscle tension all through my legs, the sides of my spine, my neck and my right side of my body.   it got so bad that it literally felt like i couldn't move, and i had this intense pain in my stomache.   i felt really cold and sleepy.   not being one for sleep i did a very very little stretching and messaging of myself, but mainly i just sat there in a kind of painful limbo just waiting for it to end.</p><p>Throughout the experiance whenever i drank water i'd feel better for a couple seconds.</p><p>All in all, ouch ouch ouch.</p>",
