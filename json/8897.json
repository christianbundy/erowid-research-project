  "I would like to share my personal experience on LSD on the day it changed my life.  To start I am relatively not new to psychedelics.  I have experimented with many substances such as mushrooms, pcp, salvia, and even ayahuasca tea.  Even though my first lsd experience was new years eve of 1999 to 2000, I was not as moved by lsd as today.  Here is my best way to share my experience:",
  "The new spring season had just begun and life was in the air.  I knew that I could find the almost myth like substance that some whisper as 'acid'.  Note: this is the first time I have come across acid since the january months of 2000.  I knew that in my correct state of mind an LSD trip would be very spiritual.  I decided to take 4 Hits of LSD with my wife (who did not take any LSD because she was pregnant at the time).  On the drive home I could see the sun setting and the colors of the purple clouds resonating from the strong spring sun.  My body started to feel hot and I felt as if I were 'sped up'.  I had done plenty of my own research to know these were the signs of a good trip.  I had no thoughts of feelings of anxiety.  I felt ready to accept life for what it had for me.  My mind started to think what seemed like ten thousand thoughts at once.  One sight at an object or even a single word could spin my mind into a bundle of sights and thoughts that opened my mind.  Here next to me was my beautiful wife pregnant with my son.  I could feel her energy, and even my unborn son (he was 7.5 months along).  Nothing else in my life began to matter except them.  My mind stayed on the thoughts of my wife and unborn son for hours.  I felt so bonded by this experience like nothing else I have ever felt. ",
  "Though most of the time I didn't receive strong visual hallucinations as I have with other lsd uses, but instead I felt touched by the minds of others speaking to me.  I felt as if I could think telepathically with others.  After of course I started to come down around 4:30 am my body was very sore.  My jaw was tight and clenching as if I were on a rollercoaster.  The entire time of coming down felt like wanting to sleep but my mind kept speaking to me so I could not find sleep for hours.  But unlike my other uses of LSD, prior to I hated the sleeplessness, but this time I appreciated it to lay in bed screaming for sleep thinking about the amazing connection I had made with my family and even humanity itself.  LSD has changed my life for the better.",
  "That being said, my suggestion to anyone that might find the myth word 'acid' if someone chooses to partake in something that can change your life in the split of a second then best wishes.  But go into your experience well equippped with knowledge.  Knowledge is power and give yourself the correct mind frame of peace. Don't be afraid to be happy.  Have a nice trip."
