  "<p>when i logged on to erowid; i couldnt believe that there were no reports on oxycontin. It has been a big drug where i live and everyone needs to know about it. I was staying at my boyfriend tim's house, when the friendly neighborhood drug dealer cam in and asked us if we wanted to try some OC's. I bought them from him and immediately popped the pill. In about 10 minutes i started to feel a rush, like on speed.",
  "I asked tim if he wanted to go for a walk somewhere since we were both buzzing around his apartment like crazy. We went for a very brisk walk for about a mile and a half. I started to feel like i was coming down from it so we turned around and went home. When we got there i immediately plopped down on the couch and started having the feeling like i had smoked extremely kind bud and opium. everything was moving slower and was very relaxing; when i closed my eyes there were some cev's and the wah-wah's.",
  "I don't know how long this lasted for since my perception of time was so fucked up. It's one of my favorites now. There is nothing like it in the world.</p>"
