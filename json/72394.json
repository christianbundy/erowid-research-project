 "report": "<p>I go to the mailbox and find the package! Woo-wee! It's morning, I'm alone at home and I got nothing else to do!</p><p>:D I have a fully empty stomach in preparation for this experience.</p><p>report hour: 12:15</p><p>reported dose: 1.7 grams over the course of 17 hours</p><p>t+00.00: taken 1 pill with 1 beer</p><p>t+00.10: nothing.....</p><p>t+00.15: slight urge to dance</p><p>t+00.20:  I burped slightly, and could feel the mephedrone taste up my throat,  interesting</p><p>t+00.25: drinking another beer, nothing else yet. snorting half a cap.... damn that hurt!!!</p><p>t+00.30: I'm getting the rushes I've been hearing about :) nice</p><p>t+00.35: THIS IS FUCKING GREAT (this is all I could write coherently at the time) The euphoria was overwhelming, it hit me full on. It was the most powerful sensation I have ever felt in my life. Objects appear with a blur and I get a sudden rush of speed in all of my limbs and body parts.</p><p>t+00.35 - 03.15: throwing myself around, being among the clouds, dancing like a maniac on any song possible. It was so unbelievable I started calling all my close friends to tell them how brilliant this BubbleLuv is! Went outside in the sun and relaxed in a chair! It was like I was melding with nature, so nice! Then I went into the middle of the street with a big smile on my face,  stood there, and raised my arms in the air as in a victory gesture... That was the best part ever, I could still hear my music from my window and felt the need to dance in the street, but I abstained myself :P</p><p>t+03.15  04.00: effects diminishing gradually</p><p>t+04.00  06.00: I guess thats the comedown... I feel pretty bored, not really in the mood to do anything, so I try to get some sleep, as I am exhausted after 4 hours of restless dancing and moving</p><p>t+06.00 - 09.00: Got some sleep! (albeit difficultly) Some really wicked, vivid dreams! I usually experience lucid dreams, in which I am aware of being in a dream, but these ones seemed so real and I remember most of them. I really was surprised by the shift in reality when I woke up, nice.</p><p>Second part of the experience: I wake up in the night. My internet isn't working and it seems it won't work until tomorrow, no one wants to go out (it's monday, eh) ...</p><p>So... Let's try to get to heaven again! :D (This part is also on a fully empty stomach)</p><p>hour: 21:45</p><p>t+00.00: snorted half a cap, this time in 2 nostrils! Much more manageable then snorting a full 100 mg up just one nostril. This is 3 times worse than K on the nose...</p><p>t+00.15: Appreciation for some chilled hip-hop and raggae music.</p><p>t+00.45: taken another cap to get some full effects.</p><p>t+01.00: wow! now it's becoming pretty speedy - listening to drum'n'bass now</p><p>t+01.15: The speed continues to increase: It's time for some speedcore.</p><p>t+01.30: Time for another dose to continue the trip of a lifetime :)</p><p>t+01.50: Now I'm a one man rave. cheers! Having so much fucking fun!</p><p>t+02.05 - 02.15: Some orgasmic heat waves through my body compelled me to start masturbating... weird! I went with the flow anyway :) The feeling was awesome! It was pretty hard if not impossible for me to get a full erection on this but it sure felt fucking awesome!</p><p>t+02.20: Snorted on whole cap to to this high euphoria up!!!</p><p>t+02.30: Full on euphoria!!! Nasal doses act much quicker and with a much bigger slap it seems. mephedrone is fucking awful on the sinuses, lemme tell you that, I feel like someone poked them with a big needle!</p><p>t+03.25: took out another beer! this certainly will up the effect of...... the next cap I'm going to take! Now I understand how this is fiendish... But it sure pays, the feeling that I don't need any other drug mephedrone gives is great!</p><p>t+03.50: the other cap :) I have a good feeling about this! My net is now working so I can talk to people too :D</p><p>t+04.20: The effects come again, this time in a more chilly manner, I feel like smoking a joint to go with this</p><p>t+04.55: Now I begin to go into a phase when I am concentrated on every song, I understand every little sound. And I'm merging with the music. The tolerance is there, but not REALLY that much... I haven't made the follow-up doses bigger, but the same or smaller, and every time I very satisfyingly trip! :)</p><p>t+05.10: Feeling tingling sensations all over my body, especially my face, this is cool :) Think will up a massive dose later on! It's gonna be HEAVAN :P</p><p>t+05.35: Now comes the biggest dose of the night! Just took 2 caps at the same time I think this will hit me hardcore (btw Im still feeling those tingling sensations all over, and experiencing some mild jaw clenching)</p><p>t+05.45: I feel the jaw clenching going away, hope when the trip blows I wont pay much attention to it anymore Anyway I just feel it when I try to smile, so its not that bad :)</p><p>t+06.05: Wow this is announcing itself to be as good a trip at the first one from this morning</p><p>t+06.20: mild reduction in effects</p><p>t+06.50: The trip is a mild one ( I think 2 beers would have been better with that last dose, oh well :P ) Anyway its a really chilled out pleasant trip, and I seem to be taking great pleasure in playing arcade games, interesting</p><p>t+07.20 - 08.00: Im slowly going to baseline... It seems my writing skills were somewhat lacking at this time (I only noticed the mistakes I made then the next morning)</p><p>t+08.15: Any trance except the tingling in various bodyparts is gone - now the tingling has come back with a vengeance it seems! :))</p><p>t+08:30 I look in the mirror and my pupils are still noticeably dilated, strange...</p><p>t+08.45 - 09.00: I'm in bed, trying to sleep, this is really difficult - What happens right now is pretty funny - Every time I close my eyes I start seeing Tetris being played, by me. After keeping my eyes closed for 3 minutes or so, I start getting some small weird dreams, and voices in my head, but I quickly wake up again after each one.</p><p>t+09.15 - 09.45: Ok, now I still can't sleep, and I go to check my watch ( It's 7:30 AM dammit, I gotta get some sleep ) and my pupils (they were normal). Now something pretty strange happens: I start seeing ripples and waves on my ceiling and walls. A few minutes after that, the effects change - When I keep my eyes open, every 3-4 seconds a flash of bright yellow and white light appears in front of my eyes, intriguing... I finally start to get sleepy. ( I think I fell asleep at aprox. t+09.45 or 8 AM)</p><p>t+10.45 - 10.50: I wake up again to piss... I'm pissing like an elephant. Oh, now here's an interesting note: I drank AT LEAST 8 litres of water and 2 litres of beer throughout the whole report. I had no idea someone could drink that much water. I come back from the toilet, and get into my bed, only to realise I am feeling really cold! (the temperature in the room was 25 - 30 degrees celsius) really strange... I throw a blanket over myself and fall asleep again.</p><p>t+14:50: I wake up. I feel pretty good! The first thing I did was piss, and the second was to come and finish this report (I really enjoyed the experience and not writing a report about this would have been a shame) The only bad thing is the pain in my foot soles I got from 4 hours of jumping around like a madman.</p><p>This small meph binge was absolutely worth it! I never thought a legal stimulant could be this potent and mind-blowing. I look forward to repeating the experience at a party somewhere sometime in the future, but take this as a friendly warning: DON'T take this day in day out, this is really heavy on the heart and the respiratory system from what I could gain.</p>",
