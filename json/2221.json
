 "report": "<p>A while ago, I had 15mg of foxy methoxy. I've found that 25mg is a good dose orally, so my assumption was that 15mg would result in 'not-high-enough' syndrome. What to do, what to do?</p><p>I decided to snort it!</p><p>I looked all over the net and asked various people (the kind of people who would know) if anyone had snorted it, and whether it worked. Nobody seemed to know!</p><p>So, I figured the typical 1:2:4 (smoke:snort:eat) ratio would apply to Foxy, and snorted 10mg at around 9pm. I felt an alert almost immediately, and knew that it was going to work. I found myself at a ++ at about 20 minutes. It was very comfortable in the nasal region, comparable to ketamine. However, the drip out of the sinus (as I, as a good snorter, kept it there as long as possible) BURNED rather intensely. I got some apple cider to wash the taste out of my mouth and this helped the burn syndrome. Specifically, I kept the cider circulating and focused it on the back of my mouth where the foxy was dripping out. The burn didn't totally go away until I cleared my sinus aroudn T+30min. I rented 'A Fistful of Dollars' at about T+1 and had a very nice time watching it. I was high in the typical foxy way, some visual 'difference', interesting auditory enhancement but very lucid mindspace.</p><p>Around T+2:30 I snorted the remaining 5mg. Same burn, etc., although the boosted effects seemed to come on faster. I was high quite late into the night. One thing I've noticed about foxy (any method) is that it tends to cause muscle tension for me. My sinus was a little bit odd the next day, but not significantly messed up.</p><p>In conclusion, snorting foxy works. My assumption is that it will last shorter than oral dosing as long as you don't boost it like I did. I like foxy. </p>",
