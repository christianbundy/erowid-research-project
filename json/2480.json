 "report": "<p>I went to hippie 2000 event, where i bought what i thought 5 pills of MDMA, after taking one pill (my usual dose), I whased it down with water, half an hour had passed and i didn't get the usual jaw clenching. So I took another... hour later another... until all five were ingested. After taking the last one 10-15 min later, I developed difficulty breathing, and had to walk around to get me counciously watch over the breathing process (not very pleasant!).  by that time it was time to boogie home. So i got in the car and drove, after about 30 min the unpleasant feeling of suffocation becane unbearable and i got off the road to stop by my ex (at 5 am... imagine that), the panic was setting in, and i was another 30m away from home.</p><p>I didn't get to my beloved EX (i wonder what would she say then?), and had to pull over by the park near by. Where i collapsed on the grass... X amount of time later i woke up with immence pain in my heart and left arm which grew to both arms and stomach (imagine an elephant standing on your chest) the nerves in my arms and hands felt like being of fire and my musculse started to convulse.(SP). after about 3-4 round trips around the park; again very painful... i had enough thought process by that time to limp home...I HAVEN'T SLEPT FOR TWO DAYS NOW it's four (in the mourning) the next day. and i'm popping valerian to stop myself from poggo dancing... this sucks</p><p>P.S. was that a heart attack? at 23?</p>",
