  "I would like to share an account of my most recent XTC experience. I am a 23 year old male, 155lbs, very fit and healthy. I have a college degree in Studio Art, and  over the past 5-6 years, I have experimented with almost every drug that is known to man.  Over the past 2 years, the only substances I have used have been pot and the occasional XTC use. The last time I had taken XTC was exactly 6 months ago to the day. Note: I have used, acid, psychodelic mushrooms, and mesciline, several times on separate occasions, but never had hallucinations as vivid and intense as I do whenever I take XTC. I dont know why this is, the XTC I get is always different, so maybe its just the way my body reacts to it. Also, I have taken XTC on at least 20 seperate occasions. Another note, within the past 6 months I have started out on my own spiritual path. I have been involved in a lot of meditation, energy body raising, astral projection, lucid dreams, etc. I had not taken any phycadelics since starting on this path.",
  "This story starts with a friend of mine who well call A, who is female. I wont get into specifics, but we have had an interesting relationship to say the least. A and I had been learning about esoteric work together, and feel that we are spiritual partners destined to help each other. There had been some uncomfortable tension between us recently, and I knew we needed to get rid of it. I felt that us sharing an XTC experience was exactly what was needed. A had never tried any substances besides alcohol and pot in her whole life.",
  "I had planned this 2 weeks in advance, and talked with A about all of my experiences with XTC, all the possibilities, and the dangers. I had her read up online, so she could get a good feel for what she was to expect. The day of nervous anticipation (for both of us) had finally arrived, and I arrived at As house with my backpack full of toys, among them 6 hits of Super White Butterflies XTC tablets. I will now show you the exact, word for word written account I tried, yes tried to keep during this experience. Afterwards I will elaborate further.",
  "2:23pm- I drop 2 pills, A drops 1",
  "2:38pm- I think I feel some stomach anxiety, A feels nothing ",
  "2:40pm, I hit each of low grade pot",
  "2:45pm, I feel floaty sensations, A feels nothing",
  "2:50pm, I feel a pit in my stomach its coming on now",
  "2:52pm, A coming on now",
  "2:53pm, nasty taste in mouth (me)",
  "2:55pm, coming on really strong, A coming on too",
  "2:56pm, hitting hard! Dont want to write anymore! (barely legible)",
  "3:01pm, (unlegible)everything is perfect!",
  "3:10pm, 3rd eye visuals, this is dopey E!",
  "3:30pm, first wave over, 1 hit of pot, back up! Alicia Keys!",
  "5:00pm, drop another hit of E",
  "-and that was the last of the note taking for the day. I will now further elaborate on the above.",
  "At the point when A was first hitting hard, I walked up, and gave her what felt like the biggest hug on earth. She just smiled and her face looked like a 5 year old on Christmas morning. We were both kind a pacing around, listening to Rusted Root, and I said to her isnt this music absolutely amazing! A agreed that is was. I changed the music to some burnt copies of techno CDs I had brought. A never really had any interest in techno music, but she was so mesmerized by it, I knew she was finally seeing it for what it really was. For the first 2 hours, we were just chilling out, stretching, hugging, giving each other massages, and talking. A was truly amazed with her new perception of things.",
  "At about 5pm, both of us had been up and down a few times, so I decided it would be wise to take another pill.  I didnt want to give A another whole one, so I attempted to bite one pill in half. Im not sure how much went in my mouth, but the piece that remained was about 2/3 to . I asked her Does this look like half? She had no idea and neither did I, but she was brave and ate it anyway. I took another whole one on top of the piece I had.",
  "After we took our 2nd set of pills, we went into As bedroom which we had earlier made totally dark for just this reason. She lay on her bed, and I went into my bag of tricks to get my glow sticks. A had never been to a rave or anything of the sort, so I wanted to try to give her the full range of trippy stuff that I had seen in my days.   So I put on some of my favorite techno and danced like a mofo. I dont remember the duration of this private dance-a-thon, but at one point I remember asking her for shoe laces, so I could tie the glow sticks on the ends and dance some more. I have no idea how long this went on for, but for us it was timeless. 1 second and forever all at once.",
  "The rest of the events/experiences, I cannot for the life of me, determine the chronological order of. I am sure that they happened, Im just not sure exactly when. At around 6-7pm I took the last pill myself. I could tell that A would be all set for the rest of the night. This puts me @ 4.5 pills and A@ 1.5 total. I remember sitting down with A and showing her a ton of my artwork I had brought with me. She had only seen one piece that I had done prior to this day, and was quite interested in seeing more, especially in this state. I loved looking at my art when I was rolling/hallucinating. The nature of my work goes so well with this drug. I wish I could show all of you what I mean. In my bag of tricks I had also brought a bunch of these plastic smiley faces/peace signs/shapes that glow in the dark. I remember opening the bag that they came in, and dumping them all over A. We played with them for a while and both started chewing on them to ease our jaw tension.",
  "A is a writer and had been having a small case of writers block recently. She kept telling me these really deep realizations she was having about herself and life in general. Every time she would say something to me, I would look at her with a smile and say Are you writing this down? and she would go scampering off to her notebook, with a huge smile on her face.",
  "Hallucinations- let me say again, I never hallucinate like I do on XTC. Now I catagorize my hallucinations into 2 sections. The first are the little quirks and jumps of physical objects normally associated with acid or shrooms. I will call these Type 1 hallucinations. The second type are the ones when I truly believe I have left my body, and am in an alternate time/space, experiencing first hand events that I am physically nowhere near. These will be referenced as Type 2 hallucinations.",
  "Type 1 hallucinations: at first it was the normal stuff, the textured ceiling taking on all kinds of likeness, pictures (especially my art) morphing into other things, constantly moving, even 3D objects taking on strange characteristics. An example was the ceiling fan that hung over As kitchen table. It was your run-of-the-mill ceiling fan, with a 4-pronged fan and 3 dangling light fixtures. This fan knew I was tripping hard, and wanted to mess with me all night long. I would look at it, it would drop down from the ceiling 6 inches, completely rotate 45o degrees (my view of it, not the fan blades), attach itself to the wall, drop to the floor, then snap back up into the ceiling. It did this with the most interesting jerky, almost robotic fashion. Then it would turn into a huge bumble-bee, then, a dog riding in a helicopter. All night long, this fan wanted to amuse me, which it certainly did.",
  "I remember looking outside from the couch. A has a huge tree blocking the view from her balcony. As I looked at the tree, the tree  looked back at me, smiled, and said Hi! A moment passed, then it said  Now do you get it? Now I didnt hear this, or see this, but KNEW it. I knew the tree was communicating to me, and I understood. This makes me wonder if trees and other inatimate objectsare always trying to communicate with us",
  "Type 2 hallucinations: The few I remember (I know there were more that were lost in my madness at the time) were absolutely amazing. The first ones were sort of puzzling to me, and I still dont entirely understand them. I would close my eyes and see a random scene of everyday life. A parking lot, people loading groceries into a car, a side walk scene. I had never physically been to any of these places I was seeing, and your guess is as good as mine as to where they actually were. As I started to make note of these, I told A about them. Then I realized that I could close my eyes and see these scenes, while still talking with A and relate to her what I was seeing. This is not exact, but it was something like this: A man walking on the street, a traffic jam, a piece of machinery, the taillight on a car, a swimming pool, people fighting, a policeman  chasing someone, someone got shot, broken glass.etc. Now each of these visions was unrelated to the last. I did actually see someone get shot by a policeman, and for some reason when I trip I do tend to see violent events taking place.",
  "Now Im not a violent person by any means, and if I had seen something like this in physical reality, Im sure I would be quite upset. For some reason though, it didnt bother me in the least bit to be seeing these things. I was like a totally neutral observer, no emotion, no response. The most profound, what I believe was an OBE (out of body experience) during this day I believe I ruined because I was unaware of what was happening at the time. I was on the couch, eyes closed, and making note of the fractal patterns and shapes in my head. Now I by no means want this to sound like a clich, but honest to Gods truth this is what happened. All of the sudden, Im in a tunnel. A dark tunnel. At the end is a door. The door is sooooo beautiful. Its like an indigo blue color, with some intricate designs on it. There were also some red highlights on some of the details. The door is very old, old but beautiful. From behind the door light is shining through the sides, top and bottom. As I approach the door from the end of the tunnel, a calmness comes over me. I get to the door, and this is the point I realize what is happening, open my eyes, gasp, and loose it.",
  "I look up to the corner of the room, and thats where I felt like I was, up in the ceiling. This may be hard to understand, because it is for me. I tell A what I just saw, and she says dude you were out of your body! I believe that I was.",
  "Around 11:30pm, both A and I had just about had enough, we were tired, but still tripping hard. We went to bed and woke up the next morning @5:30am for some reason. We sat together and talked for 6 hours about everything we had seen, felt and done. This experience was great for the both of us, and I believed it truly changed As previous sometimes negative outlook on things. She is much happier now, and accepts herself for who she is, and not what others think. A has since been unlocking the potential of the great person that is inside her, who I had always seen, although slightly blocked.",
  "There is a lot more that happened this magical evening, but time nor space permits me to go further. I believe every experience is what you make of it, and planning played a big part in this trip. My times using XTC are becoming less and less frequent, but more profound and deep each time.",
