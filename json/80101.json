 "report": "<p>I have taken flurazepam on multiple occasions, one thing they all had in common was the drug left a nasty taste in my mouth for a day after taking it.  It was the least euphoric and the worst curer of anxiety of all the benzos I've taken.  But I think that is because it lasts so long I don't notice the 'peak' as I do with xanax.  It kept me from withdrawaling, but didn't help any anxiety or help me sleep.  The most I ever took was 3 30mg capsules, it just didn't touch me - probably because I was used to popping 3 bars a day.  It is used for sleeping, but I never really got tired.  Throughout my use with the drug I tried oral, shooting, and snorting and nothing gave me the benzo relief I was used to.  But the thing I remember the most about it is that always left bad tastes in my mouth.</p>",
