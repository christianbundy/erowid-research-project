 "report": "<p>Well, being bored and weedless one evening I discovered that I could get high of Gravol. Not only get high, but actually hallucinate! After reading a few reports on I came to the conclusion it was very similar to Datura, except it didn't last nearly as long. This sort of scared me, because I've always considered that to be the only drug I may not be able to handle. I know that's ignorant to say, and I'll probably pay for it one day, but oh well, that's the way I see it. Note that all hallucinations in this first trip were in very dark settings. Most of which were in a room with light only entering from streetlights shining through a window.</p><p>Anyhow, after carefully considering it for a few days I decided 'What the hell!' and dropped 800 mgs. I had a shower, and after some more thought I decided to drop another 100 mgs just in case. This was about 15 minutes after the first dose. I concluded that would be more than enough to do the trick, and went to my room to watch tv.</p><p>After about an hour I got rather tired. I'm not sure if this was because of the pills, or because I was sitting in my bed doing nothing entertaining, but either way it hit me hard. I decided to get up, because I didn't want to fall asleep before the trip started. I was rather entertained by the fact that getting out of bed proved to be difficult. I was clearly a bit intoxicated, and it reminded me of a similar occurance when I had dropped a shitload of temazepam. I guess to someone who hasn't done that, it could be compared to being really drunk. It's like the uncoordination of having a few too many, without the visual distortion.</p><p>After trying to keep myself awake for another hour and a half, I noticed that my condition wasn't changing, if anything my coordination had improved. So I decided that I probably hadn't dosed enough and went to bed. This was approx. 2.5 hours after injestion.</p><p>'Not right now, I'll sell you them later!' was the first thing I heared upon waking up. The person who said it clearly sounded frustrated and annoyed. Quickly I realized it was me, and noticed someone from my school (not really a friend, I guess an aquantince) was standing beside my bed. Quickly I realized that there was no was this could be possible, as it was the middle of the night. The instant I concluded this, he disappeared.</p><p>I knew right then and there the effects had hit me hard. Luckily my head seemed to be in the same place. With pretty much every drug I've done, the way I think had changed in some way or another, which is what I found interesting about dimenhydrinate. The trip seemed purely physical, any changes in my mindset were due to the things I was interacting with. In other reports I had read, users noted it felt like being in a dream. Possibly because I was aware of this and kept telling myself to 'stay alert and stay focused' I kept my mind in the right place, maybe it was the doseage, I'm not sure.</p><p>Either way, I knew I was headfirst in the trip. I decided to look at my clock to note when I first noticed the effects, with the idea that I might submit a report. My room was dark, and my light had broken earlier that day, so I could only see a small outline of my nighttable and alarm clock in the darkness. After reaching where I saw the clock, my hand went right through it and hit my wall rather hard. This scared me because my parents were in the room next to me, and I had to be very careful not to wake them up. I decided that my eyes weren't gonna do shit for me, so I closed them and felt for where I knew the clock was. After a few minutes I finally found it and pressed the glow light.</p><p>To my dismay, all the numbers were scrambled. Well, they weren't even numbers, just those lines the numbers in digital clocks are made of. They would jump all over the place and make weird symbols and shapes. Normally I would enjoy this and trip to this and enjoy it for a while, but in this case it just pissed me off.</p><p>I then realized I had to go to the bathroom REALLY bad, so I turned to the other side of my bed and sat up. To my surprise, my dad was standing by my door with a shocked look on his face. He just stood there, looking at me in discust. I knew that it was probably just a hallucination, but I had no real way of telling, so I played along anyhow. In a really quiet voice I whispered 'What's wrong?' and he still just stood there with that same horrible look. Again I said 'What? I'm just tired.' I said this because I figured if he was real, he knew I was fucked up. I don't remember exactly what happened after that, but my next memory was standing by my door trying to get back into my room. I know I must have gone to the bathroom, I just don't remember it. I'm assuming my confrontation with my dad was a hallucination, as there was no talk of it the next day.</p><p>My ability to judge distance between myself and other objects was horribly distorted. As I tried to get back in my room, I slammed my hand into the door multiple times because I thought it was further than it was, and it took me forever to find my doorknob in the darkness. Once I finally got back into bed, I noticed a lighter was on the covers in front of me. I reached for it, but again my perception of distance was distorted and my hand landed a good few inches away from it. I sat up in my bed and reached a little further, and still it wasn't far enough. Soon I was on my hands and knees reaching for it, and it kept getting further and further away. Eventually it was at the very edge of my bed, and finally I got my hand on top of it, but strangely I didn't feel it. I lifted my hand up and it was gone.</p><p>This was the first hallucination that I had automatically assumed was real. When I found out I was wrong and had just spent a few minutes trying to pick something up that wasn't there, I got extremely annoyed. It was actually rather embarassing, even though I was the only one there, I felt ashamed that I fell for it, after prepping myself so much ahead of time. Again my memory is a bit hazy, but I do know I spent some more time clearing things off my bed, falling for it every time. Every time I thought 'Okay, that last thing wasn't real but I'm SURE this thing is.' It was really fucking annoying. That's about the only way I can put it. Eventually I'd had enough and just went to bed.</p><p>The next day I didn't feel too great, a bit hungover I guess. I still felt a bit 'weird' and often when entering a room, I felt the presence of other people there. At one point I was watching TV and actually thought my mom was in another chair in the room. I looked over to say something to her and felt really stupid when no one was there. So I guess in a sense it was similar to the hallucination of seeing people without the actual visual aspect.</p><p>After a few days of recovery, I decided to jump right at it and try again. I was amazed by the power of a completely legal pill which I had never even heard of as a hallucinogen before. What is interesting is that this was a completely different trip, and a friend was present (he didn't dose) so I figured I'll include this trip in the report as well.</p><p>Again I decided to go with 900 mg's. It wasn't too intense, but good enough to hallucinate, and I wanted to be coherent enough to be social with my friend. I'm trying to figure out what made this trip so different. I'm guessing it was because the first time I had dosed with 100 mg pills, and this time the majority of them were 50 mg's. The effects the second time started much faster, so maybe with smaller pills it kicks in quicker.</p><p>Either way, 45 minutes after dropping I said two words to my friend that said it all; 'I'm fucked'. This time, my mindset definitely changed, as opposed to the first time. The best way I can describe it was I felt very alone and lonely, even in the presence of a friend. My stomach was also hurting pretty bad. We were watching a movie, but I found I couldn't really focus on it. My vision was also getting distorted, I can compare it to the day after a roll after staying up all night. Objects were 'twitching' and there were little 'strings' everywhere, as if they were actually on my eyeball. They had a delayed movement if I moved my eyes. If I were to move them to the left, about half a second later these strings would follow, it was weird.</p><p>It was around this time I started to get scared. I looked at how much I tripped when it took over 2 and a half hours to kick in, now it's been just 45 minutes and I'm already feeling it strong. I decided to go to the bathroom, and already my coordination was off. Walking there and back proved to be quite a challenge. Half an hour later I was in the same state, but my friend really wanted to smoke weed. I decided 'What the hell', so we blazed a bowl or two.</p><p>This surprisingly didn't even seem to effect me, except I got extremely tired within minutes. We went back and continued watching the movie, when I saw my one of my sisters come into the room. She just said 'What the fuck are you guys on??' and I replied with 'Nothing, go to bed.' My friend just looked at me and said 'What the hell are you talking about?' I knew what was going on immediately, I didn't even have to look back to see that my sister wasn't there.</p><p>I decided right then and there it was time for me to go to bed. Later that night my friend came into my room to ask me something (he was crashing on my sofa), and I just told him to fuck off. The next day he was kinda pissed, but I had just thought he was a hallucination and didn't want to be bothered.</p><p>It's an interesting experience and I don't regret it, but it's by no means 'fun'.</p>",
