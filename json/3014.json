 "report": "<p>About a month ago, a friend and I somehow came upon 60mg of a new substance, 2C-T-7.  The guy we got it from was a friend who had bought 120mg and took 30 with a friend of his.  When we heard of it, we bought it and went home to research it. </p><p>I must stress this: 2C-T-7 is extremely powerful!</p><p>Here is my mental log of what happened:</p><p>8:15pm (T = 0:00h) - After not eating anything all day we ingested 30mg dissolved in water.  The taste was rather strange although not difficult to handle.  I was very anxious too see what this would be like.  Luckily, we were in a house with good friends and a very long time period before we had any plans with the outside world.   </p><p>9:00pm (T+0:45h)  -  Nausea setting in. I remember reading reports of a couple people puking, and I almost convince myself I would soon.  We are sitting up in a bed with the lights on, nausea is trading off with mdma-type feeling setting in.</p><p>9:20pm (T+1:05h) - Didn't puke yet, and my, my, these visuals are starting come in nicely.  Mind is still relaxed. </p><p>9:30pm (T+1:15h) - I would say that this stage was when I really started to understand what I was in for.  The visuals were fantastic for the next 3-5 hours.  Colors and lights were on another level as far as shrooms or lsd is concerned.  I somehow asked myself mentally if things were more organic or geometric and that became a theme for a while.  I held an old soccerball in my hands and the pentagons were pulsing and fractaling inward to the white space which appeared translucent.  The ball became a membrane with veins and an inner glowing light secreted through the black spaces,in what appeared to be a liquid. </p><p>My favorite aspect about 2ct7 is something I have termed 'Input Currency Equalizing.'  I discussed this with my friend who also felt the same experience.  If your mind could take all of its sensory inputs and make them 1 universal currency, and then freely distribute it to random sensors, you could experience this one part of 2ct7.  For example, I was sitting in a chair with newspapers at my feet.  I was barefoot and tripping of into the greatest mindscapes ever when my feet started to crinkle the newspaper.  Good lord! All of a sudden, my images were starting to crinkle and react to what I was feeling.  I could rub the sofa and flatten the image.  This was such a fun time!</p><p>Another aspect I found new with 2ct7 was reverberated tactile inputs.  I could rub my hand along a surface and experience like an echo of that feeling for a couple seconds.  Textures were not only visually appealing, but also tactilly interesting.  When people ask me if it was more like lsd or mdma, I tell them 2ct7 is in a different league than (safe levels) lsd and mmda.  Mdma is more euphoric but 2ct7 is more raw feeling.  The visuals add so much more than lsd.  Lights from other rooms flooded in with waves of color and temperature.  Dark rooms were only dark rooms for a couple of seconds.  Light crept into the room and then suddenly washed everything.  Closed eye visuals were a little too intense for me.  I would try to close them to get blackness, but no luck, the 2ct7 could render anything from any perspective with any effect instantly.  Unreal.   </p><p>The come down was probably the best come down I've ever had.  No achiness, no headache, no wired feeling.  Just release and awe.  The morning after was like any other (physically) besides our constant ranting on  2ct7 to others.</p><p>The only fault I find in 2ct7, is that it is so powerful, and so awesome, that I couldn't talk to anyone while tripping.  I like my psychedelics to allow me to communicate and build theories with others.  Anytime anyone asked me what it was like while I in the heavy zone I would just turn to them and say, 'Well, its, well, wow. Holy Shit! AAA! ok! It's...' and on and on until they went away.  Maybe it was just the fact it was my first mega psychedelic.  This stuff is awesome.  If you ever lose faith in the human brain, try 2ct7 and sit back, try to relax, and try not to devote the rest of your living life to spreading the goodness of 2ct7.  A highly recommended trip.  A++++++++</p><p>A quick note: I think the next time I come across this holy material, I will take less (probably 20mg) to see if I can handle it better.</p>",
