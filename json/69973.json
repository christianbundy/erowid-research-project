 "report": "<p>A few months back, one of my good friends who is experienced with hallucinogens told me about 2C-I. He told me he could get me some for $7, so I agreed, and finally got a hold of some this past weekend. I called up my best friend and told him what I had and said that I needed a sitter so I could take it a few days later (yesterday). I had read more in-depth about the drug so I could get a better idea of what to expect and to make sure my mind was completely at rest.</p><p>I got home from work at about 9:15pm and called up my friend (let's call him J) to tell him to head over. I then took the 20mg capsule at 9:20 and waited for him to show up. When he got here, we left to go drive around a bit and ended up walking around Walmart about an hour after I ingested. The effects came on gradually. My jaw started to shiver a bit and I was getting real giggly. Mostly about nothing and the rest of the time it was about stuff that wasn't even funny, such as when we walked back out to J's car he whispered, 'Look what the monsters did to my car!' I assume he did this just to fuck with me, but it made my go into hysterics. I couldn't stop laughing for about a half an hour about this and at times it would come up later in the night and it was still just as funny.</p><p>We got back to my house, where we would remain for the rest of the night. I had to go to the bathroom, so I went in and sat down on the toilet. I had the feeling of being really drunk. This is when the 2C-I hit me full on. Upon focusing on the walls, they began to 'breathe.' I found this extremely amusing and started giggling again. Looking at a washcloth draped over something in my shower, it started to exponentially increase in size and gyrated as if it were a live snake. This also amused me and I began laughing hysterically.</p><p>I got back to my room and laid down. I felt fantastic, except for a bit of a queezy feeling in my stomach, but that wasn't a big deal. We proceeded to play video games for the next few hours. My attention span was awful and I couldn't focus much on the task at hand. I was too interested in what I would see if I looked around. We ordered a pizza and, even though I wasn't hungry, I ate half of it. Swallowing this pizza made my throat feel like it was having an orgasm. My stomach began to hurt, but I kept eating because of how great it felt. Afterwards, everything tickled. The slightest sounds would make my entire body feel like I was being tickled by a thousand fingers. Hysterical laughing ensued again.</p><p>J became disinterested in video games and decided to listen to an iDoser (a brainwave manipulating program) on my laptop. He turned all the lights off and laid down on my bed. I then found video games to be boring, so I laid down next to him and just put my fingers over my eyes. The open-eye visuals were cool and all, but the closed-eye visuals completely blew me away. Right as I began to focus on relaxing, a brand new world of vibrant colors and geometric shapes began to unfold before me. I was in complete awe of what I was seeing and found out that I could actually manipulate these colors and shapes. I began playing around inside my mind, but it seemed that my mind still had control over me, as when I got carried away with manipulating things, a massive sweeping feeling would come over my entire brain. It was the most amazing feeling and it was as if my brain was telling me, 'I am allowing you to explore, but don't go too far.' J later told me that during this entire period I was twitching around like crazy; almost seizure-like.</p><p>After a while of this, J got tired and went to bed. I was in about the fifth hour of my trip, so I still had a bit to go. I walked over to my computer and turned on Shpongle's album 'Tales of the Inexpressible,' which is by far one of the most amazing experimental PsyTrance/Ambiance albums ever created. I laid down on my bed again with all the lights off and the music took over me. I don't exactly remember everything that I saw, but I did get up after the album was over (it's a little over an hour long) and document the biggest parts of this experience. Here is what I wrote:</p><p>'I feel like I have seen the break between Heaven and Hell. The great battle. I HAVE seen it. I saw when God made His final push. I saw the Fallen One ride down the clear rivers of Heaven while all of His angels watched on in sorrow. They are sad for him. I was sad for him. I saw him plunge into the darkness. I sat with God on His throne and watched as he fell deeper. I shared His sorrow. His pain was mine. The Fallen One was no longer in God's light. Was no longer in the clear waters of Heaven. He was instead in a domain of his making. One filled with darkness. The waters were so black if it weren't for the faint shimmer of fire you couldn't even tell there was anything there. I was with him. I witnessed it.</p><p>I know what it's like to die. As more and more is taken from you during your life. What is gone can only look on in longing for what it once had. Until the last of you is gone. You are left looking back at what you once had. The life you led. The world you inhabited. I was then at my funeral. It was short. I came to life in the casket. Everything turned to fire. Everything was a glowing orb of energy. Then I suddenly broke out of the planet and I was reborn. I could not see my hands. I couldn't see my arms. There was nothing to look at. I'm not even sure if I had eyes. But I knew they were around me. Masses of beings looking up at me. Cheering. They had been awaiting my arrival. I then recognized faces. Ones that had been lost in time. I thought I'd never see them again. I then realized that I was in Heaven. I was with my old friends, my parents, my family. All those that were lost. I was finally with them. I was home. They were happy. So was I.</p><p>After her visit I awakened. It was as if I had slept for decades. I am finally alive. I must reluctantly return to sleep. Rest assured, I will visit again. I will reawaken. I will come back to life. I will see you again.'</p><p>As I read over these things today, I vividly remember all of what I wrote. If I could even begin to put words to my vision, I would. All I can say is that it proved to me that God exists and that there should be no fear in death; answers two issues that have endlessly run through my mind over the last five or six years.</p><p>After I awoke from this hallucination-coma (I believe I passed out during this, I don't remember opening my eyes at all), I looked at the clock and it was about 3am and I wanted to go to sleep. The visuals had died down enough that I could, but I still felt so awake that I just couldn't drift into sleep. Also, I had a splitting headache and that didn't help much at all. After getting up and messing around on the computer and watching TV for a while, I finally found a way to sleep around 5am.</p><p>This has got to be one of the best experiences of my life and definitely a great start for me in the realm of hallucinogens. I'll conclude this with a line from StarShpongled Banner, a song from Tales of the Inexpressible, that seemed to leave an indelible mark on me: 'I am a shaman magician, the sun is purple. 3D dimensions, I am for mental extensions.'</p>",
