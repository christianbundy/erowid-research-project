 "report": "<p>\nI was always unaware of nutmeg throughout my days as an occasional pot smoker, but having recently visited Erowid, i had read enough and wanted to give this drug a whirl. I have never done acid, so I didn't know what to expect in terms of seeing things. Also, I was intrigued by the number of people that wrote in giving nutmeg a sort of thumbs-up.</p><p>On my way home from college, I stopped into this health food section of the shopping mall and purchsed (for 85p) a bag of 6 nutmegs. When I was home, I ground up a nutmeg into a dose of milkshake. It wasn't that bad at all taste-wise, but it took a lot more to get down another two nuts. While I sat down, listening to music and playing my drum-kit (as well as picking the bits from my teeth), I was trying to distinguish if there was anything in this besides potentail placebo.</p><p>When I came downstairs, I had chili and a beer and watched some tv, and I felt it coming on (only 2.5-3 hours after ingestion). It was like pot, but a little bit different, in that my short term memory was becoming increasingly and hopelessly non-existent. South Park was too great and I found myself laughing hysterically for some weird reason. I then retired back upstairs and put on music once more. I began to feel drowsier and drowsier. I sat cross legged on the floor and began to draw randomly on a piece of paper with a pen, just doodles. The intensity was like my body being under great equal pressure, tense muscles one time and then loose the next. I felt as if I could feel all my organs inside of me. Pleasant, though. As the evening wore on I became more and more vegitated. Sat like a gnome, my body feeling paralysed and my mind buzzing with heat. I could almost feel myself dribbling. I retired to bed 8 hours after ingestion, feeling quite wasted.</p><p>All next day, the same feeling continued. It was becoming too intense to handle. I got quite paranoid, anxious and above all just plain tired, like I had just walked for my entire life. Sometimes the feeling would surge and I could barely talk to my parents. I hung my head with my chin on my chest most of the time. I had a few little stomach pains and found it hard to pass water. But I could sleep. If I wanted to I could have slept the whole thing out, but I was curious to see what would happen.</p><p>One time that night, I woke thinking that lots of black figures were behind me when I saw a distorted reflection. I shit my pants.</p><p>Writing this now (Sunday), I feel a lot better. I am consuming copius amounts of food. There is definitely an increased appetite like pot, and I had some great feelings from music and all sounds not in the room. But the feeling lasted way too long. Three days it has taken to get over it. Like being stoned for three days on the trot.</p><p>I am unsure whether or not I will continue to use it. It is cheap and long-lasting, but not so good on my college coursework! I perhaps may try smaller doses.</p>",
