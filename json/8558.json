 "report": [
  "The night started off with me taking 2 Halcion and 2 small Xanax pills.  I invited my girlfriend over to keep me company.  Right before she showed up I took 1 more halcion (.25mg each) and had one small Bailey's and cream.",
  "After that drink I have barely any recollection of the night.  Apparently I was completely belligerent, fell over on multiple occasions, sang songs about being a woman, and then passed out.  While I was out my girlfriend said I was convulsing for a short period of time, and then became somewhat catatonic-  I was laying down but holding my hand up, and she could mold my fingers into any shape she liked, they would stay that way.",
  "I am lucky she stayed with me that night and kept me in check, I have no idea what else I could have done while under that heavy of an influence.",
  "That said, benzos and alcohol in general will lead to problems, and blackouts.  So doing them together is not a good idea in the first place.",
  "I use Halcion on a regular basis to help with sleep.  If I take double or triple the dosage then I get into a very hypnotic-esque mood before falling asleep, if not passing out completely.  I make hiphop beats-and have woken up the morning after a halcion use with the loop still playing 8-9 hours later.  Goofy, but true.",
  "They say Halcion isnt that great for you, especially compared to other benzos.  I enjoy using Xanax and Valium recreationally, but I find them necessary as well for my social anxiety."
