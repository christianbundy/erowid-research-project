 "report": [
  "I had drank some alcohol earlier but it had been about an hour since I had drank anything except orange juice, which I only drank a couple drinks of.  I took one hit  of JWH-018 at about 6:30 a.m. I had been smoking about 2mg of JWH-018 before bed for about two weeks because it was helping me sleep.  In fact sometimes I get these nap attacks where I will fall asleep sitting up after smoking this, then I will wake up a few minutes later and then it will happen again.  It wasn't like this was my first hit.  This was the first time I had used a pizzo style pipe (oil based pipe) to smoke it.  I felt a slight burn in my throat and a tiny bit of taste. I held it in and then blew it out and the smoke from it was as thick as if I was smoking weed.  I had never seen this much smoke from JWH-018 before and in fact there is usually very little smoke and there has never been a burn or taste to the JWH-018.  I had just poured a drink (Jack Daniels and diet coke) but I only took a couple of drinks because of what happened next. ",
  "About 15 minutes later I felt really brain high and I just kept getting higher and higher on the same hit, I never took another one.  I started getting scared because I felt too high.  My heart was racing, pounding and actually ached.  Things sort of felt hazy.  I had my friend sit in front of me and I put my hand on his arm so I could feel something real and I closed my eyes and took deep slow breaths to try and calm my body down.  It didn't work so I just laid down.  I became paranoid like something was going to happen and I wasn't going to be able to handle it because I was so high. ",
  "That probably all took 10 minutes, so it must have been just before 7:00 a.m. when I started throwing up.  I didn't make it to the bathroom first and then I had to run before I fell because I was so weak and I was going to throw up more.  I made it to the toilet and started violently throwing up.  It was so violent that my entire body was straining to throw up, not just my stomach.   The entire time I was throwing up my whole body was uncontrollably twitching.  It was about one twitch every 10-15 seconds.  Not a leg or a body part, my entire body was doing it.  I was so weak and out of it that I could barely reach my arm over my head and flush the toilet two times.  I hardly lifted my head up at all.  My friend had to flush the rest of the time.  I was unable to talk.  My brain was thinking but no words could come out of my mouth most of the time.  My friend said I was pretty much catatonic.  I thought I threw up blood I was throwing up so hard.  The only full sentence I actually got out was 'should I go to the hospital?'  I was scared to death.  My friend told me it wasn't blood it was okay I was just throwing up and he was right.  I was trying to think myself through this.  My friend reminded me that it was only supposed to last two hours and I tried using that as a way to calm myself down. Mind you, I'm still throwing up violently. ",
  "Then, my mouth got so dry and so did my throat.  I seriously had no saliva left and couldn't produce any despite trying to.  This actually made things worse.  I was throwing up only food, no fluid and because my throat was so dry (like someone wiped it out with kleenex) the food would get stuck in my throat and I choked twice so hard I almost passed out.  I had to fight to utter the word 'water' to my friend.  Normally you don't want to drink water because it makes you throw up, but I needed moisture to help the food slide out.  I know that's gross but it's the truth.  I couldn't pull myself up to the sink to get my own water and I almost used the clean water in the toilet to moisten my mouth, that's how bad it was.",
  "I was still throwing up when I got a text message from my daughter around 7:45 and I couldn't answer it.  My friend asked me what I wanted him to do like three times and I couldn't say anything.  Finally all I could barely say was 'take care of it please'  and I could hardly say it loud enough to hear and never lifted my head up to say it.  It was like my head couldn't move and talking took too much thought.",
  "About 15 minutes later I finally thought I was stopping throwing up and started lowering myself to the floor because I couldn't stand or crawl.  I thought I was just going to collapse backwards when I brought my head up from the toilet, so I hung on to the toilet and lowered myself, but as I was going down, I realized I wasn't done.  I threw up more and then was able to lower myself down onto the floor and I was so happy to feel something besides the toilet and that I was done throwing up.  The body twitching had slowed down too, but I was still twitching and still unable to utter any words.",
  "I guess I fell asleep on the floor because my friend was going to move me to the bed, but realized that I had thrown up again but I didn't know it.  This wasn't a violent throw up because he said I made no noise at all.  He said it was still dry, no fluid.  Thankfully I was on my side when I threw up.  He cleaned it up and woke me up to see if I wanted to go to bed.  I didn't want him to have to move me so I mustered my jelly like arms to hold me up and crawled a few feet before I had to lay down again.  This happened a few times.  I'd crawl and lay down for a little bit, still not talking out loud.  I had to talk myself into doing it.  Finally I was at the foot of the bed and I threw myself up onto the bed and to the pillows.  I laid there and then I got a chill or something because I got severe uncontrollable shivers, not just twitching.  My body was shaking and twitching so hard and I couldn't control it.  After my friend put blankets over me because I said 'cold' it wasn't as bad.  My body slowed down and I finally fell asleep.  This was probably about 8:20 or so. ",
  "I got about 4 hours sleep, stayed up for about 3 hours, slept for two more, so about 5pm I went down to eat.  The rest of the day I was able to function, but it wasn't until after 6pm that I actually felt normal and felt like I was in the real world.  I remember eating dinner and I felt like I was in a dream even though I was talking to real people.  It was weird.",
  "I can tell you that I don't know what I would have done if I was alone because simple things like a human touch on my shoulder, my friend's voice and him saying things like, 'you know you are throwing up but you are not sick, you are going to be okay' and 'it's not cold, you're okay' made me know I was still there.  It gave me something to fight with in my mind so I could try and stay calm and not think I was going to die.  I seriously thought that I could die while this was happening and I have never ever felt that way in my life and I'm middle aged.  If this happens to you talk yourself through it.  It did go away and there were no residual affects.  If you are with a friend that is going through this make sure they hear you and feel you, reality makes it easier to get through.",
  "Another friend of mine took too much and he was given 500mg of Piracetam to take, but only took 250 of it by insufflating it.  He felt much better but still threw up.  Another friend took Piracetam the same way, but 500 mg and it was like he was completely sober.  I personally will not be caught without Piracetam in case it happens again, I wish I knew of it before my incident."
