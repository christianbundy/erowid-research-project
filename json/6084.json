 "report": [
  "I think my obsession with drugs started when I was 3 years old. My dad was a medical rep for a major pharmaceutical company, and he always had codeine-based medicine with him. I clearly remember being away on holiday and faking a cough...I called him away from dinner and he told me to take some cough syrup. I think I probably drank the whole bottle. It was codeine and all I remember is watching mosquitoes and feeling deeply content.",
  "Fast-forward a few years and I was a vehement anti-drug protester. Then I met my first fiance and somehow started taking ecstasy. Things got very hectic, as he was a drug-dealer and when he eventually ditched me (I was 17, he was 27, things were clearly not working out) I started on my long road to hell. First it was pills, then it turned into speed-crystals, and then diet-pills. I never had much self-esteem, my parents were always going on about how fat I was (it's genetic, but try telling them that) and speed gave me the body I craved. Nevermind the psychosis and paranoia. I could gym for 4 hours a day, 6 days a week and I looked fantastic.",
  "Eventually my new boyfriend got me off speed, and all the while life was happening to me. I got a scholarship to a prestigious university to read Journalism, and turned it down for the new boyfriend who dumped me 2 months later...so back to the lovely drugs it was for me..it was all recreational though, mainly acid, pills and speed. All my friends were doing it with me. I got a new boyfriend, started at university and things were great for about 2 years. Then boyfriend dumped me and I started drinking...bottles of Jack Daniels were nothing for my voracious and destructive appetite and sleeping pills and Rohypnol were a nice extra. My second year of university is a blur...I don't even know how I passed, because I probably only attended 2 lectures that year.",
  "Fat-forward to third year...my best friend leaves for the UK and I hook up with a great guy. My best friend and I had always said that we would never be drug addicts, because we did pills only on weekends, and didn't need them during the week. With him gone, I lost my reason and when the new boyfriend confided in me, that he had a heroin problem my alarm bells didn't even ring...I thought 'oh, well, heroin can't be that bad...he's fine' Soon enough, I was trying heroin and I loved it. The next year and a half is one I would rather forget.",
  "Heroin is a delicious and evocative drug. It makes me forget that I am human and makes me think that friends are not neccessary for anyone. I spent about R60 000 in two months on crack cocaine and heroin, stole from everyone I knew including my parents, trashed my car, lied and cheated and even considered selling my body to pay off enormous debts. When it all came to a crashing halt, I was the one who had to tell everyone about my problem and the worst thing is that no-one had even noticed. I went into a self-imposed rehab, and I suppose that's where the problem lay. I never told my parents. I am an only child from a very wealthy and upper-class family. People like me do not do heroin. I was on the verge of graduating from University with a first. How could I tell my parents I was such a low-life scumbag? My dad thought I was sick and bought me methadone. I lay in bed for 2 months, on a drip, I thought I would die. Meanwhile, the boyfriend was back on H, still coming around and beating me and stealing everything.",
  "After I ditched him, I hooked up with his best friend and 2 months of being clean got destroyed when I got back into H...I relapsed 7 times. Eventually, I went to live in the states for 6 months to try sort myself out. Because I was snorting the H, never injecting, I had started doing coke, not realising that I was displaying classic replacement behaviour.",
  "I'm now back home. My recreational coke habit has escalated into a very serious drug problem...I think about coke constantly. I have a job, a degree, a car and a nice home. My parents love me and I have big plans to go and travel and start a career. But everyday I am faced with myself. I know I have such potential, I am considered very gifted and intelligent. But I am so broken by my constant abuse, that I have lost the will to live and succeed. I cannot ever see myself being a success, because I simply cannot get over the basic hurdle of making money and not buying drugs. I will go a day without coke and it feels like forever. I just wish I could see myself in 10 years and know I have a flash car and wonderful career, because I am terrified that I am going to end up broke and destitute. If I could see into the future, I wouldn't want to for fear of knowing exactly how much drugs ruined me.",
  "Some people can do drugs and some people just cannot. I am a cannot, yet it controls my life and my world like a hungry child that has never grown up. Yet, the lessons I have learned and the things I have been through have changed my life in so many ways that I am grateful for. I've been abused, beaten and in the pits of hell and it has given me a wisdom and compassion beyond my years...but this is a life I would never wish on anyone. I am not an addict - I just have a serious drug problem. If it's not one, it's the other and the very thought of not drinking has made me shudder with horror at the thought of NA. A life without drugs is no life at all...hedonism is my holy grail. But if I carry on like this, I'll die.",
