 "report": "<p>Wanting to experience an increase in sexual performance I tried yohimbe capsules found at GNC. They contain 450mg of yohimbe, and state that they are 2% alkaloids, so I figure that means it has 9mg of alkaloid. The instructions indicated to take one cap an hour before 'activity'. This was about 8 pm, and after having several beers and popcorn.</p><p>True to the directions I began to feel the effects in about an hour. Without any stimulation from my wife, I had the biggest, hardest erection ever experienced in my lifetime. It felt really great although not quite like a 'normal' erection - just different. It was at least 1 to 1 1/2 inches longer and probably 1 inch larger in circumference. My wife was stunned and asked what was going on. I hadn't told her what I was taking. I had the most explosive and mind blasting orgasm after actively going at it for about 35 minutes. I think I could have gone on even longer if I wanted to - I seemed to be in total control over my orgasm.</p><p>Now the bad part. My heart was racing the entire night, it took me 7 hours (after taking the capsule at 8pm) to fall asleep. And during the night I kept on getting erections about every 15 to 20 minutes, masturbating to get rid of them. Oh well.</p><p>Overall, I will probably take the stuff again, but this time not as late as 8pm, probably as early as 5 pm so that I can get a little sleep.</p>",
