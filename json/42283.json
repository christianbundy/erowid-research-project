 "report": "<p>After a particularly painful session with my new dentist, I had a few small cavities filled, and one large one filled. Well, I told him that the pain was bugging me (no lie, prevented me from sleeping for a whole day afterwards), he prescribed me some hydrocodone 5/500s. Well, seeing as how I am always interested in trying new ways of altering my mind, I decided to look it up on here to determine what could be done with it.</p><p>I used the cold water extraction method, after having pounded 14 of my pills to dust with a hammer while they were wrapped in a paper towel. To chill the water, I put it into the freezer, then added the powder, stirred vigorously for five minutes, then set it in my small bathroom so that no light could get at it. After a little over an hour of waiting, I went into the bathroom, and used a doubled-up coffee filter to filter out the solid and nasty smelling mess, and was left with about 3oz of the water solution. By guessing that due to the imprecise extraction process, and to the way in which I powdered my pills, I am betting that I lost somewhere in the ballpark of 10-15%, giving me somewhere between 59.5-63mg of hydrocodone.</p><p>The time of ingestion was at 12:30 in the afternoon on a sunday. I had not eaten for a dozen hours beforehand, so my stomach was bone-dry. The setting was in the darkened bathroom, after which I climbed the stairs to my room, and turned on the tv. I wasn't really paying attention, just needed to kill time till the effects kicked in. Mild effects started within ten minutes, but it wasn't until around the forty minute mark came that I felt it in force. It went from slight stomach discomfort, and a small overall body buzz, to being almost overpowering. I lay down, a huge smile never leaving my face, and drifted in and out of conciousness for seven hours. Very euphoric, far in excess of ganja I'd say, my entire body buzzing and tingling, and all my stress and anxiety melted away in an orange haze. All I could think of was that I felt great, I was healthy, young, about to enter college, and life was going really good.</p><p>After those seven hours past, my mother came home, and woke me up because she wanted me to watch a movie with her that she had just rented. I agreed, and got up slowly, still very much under the influence, still feeling wonderful and at total peace, and went downstairs to get a drink. The first tall glass of apple juice was fine, but I unwisely decided to have a second. After I finished the second glass, nausea set in, and I quickly ran to the downstairs bathroom to puke. A little over a minute later, I rinsed my mouth out with some water, and went back to the movie. I slowly came down to baseline over the next three hours, but I felt aftereffects of peacefulness, and noticed that things bothered me less for the next two days.</p><p>Overall I'd say that this is a wonderful drug, one which I will most certainly be experimenting with again, hopefully soon. The only two things I would do differently would be to take a smaller dose, as at that level it was hard to remain conscious to enjoy it, and to not have a second glass of apple juice.</p>",
