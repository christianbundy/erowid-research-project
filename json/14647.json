  "<p>Fist off, ths substance was purchased over the net, by a friend of mine now refered to as Mr. E. He bought 500 mgs for 90$, but because of mailing complicaions was given 1,000 mgs. The substnce was given in a short, clear-brown vial.",
  "Upon the label was stated:",
  "(alpha,O-Dimethylserotonin DANGER- NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. For Research/Laboratory Use only. Purity 99.5%)",
  "Mr. E gave me an eyed-out dose of (approx.) 5-10 milligrams (I wouldn't recommend doing so), which he had put into an emptied 100-mg. gelatin vitamin capsule. He had used it previously (my dose), so he gave himself an approx. 10-15 mg. dose",
  "Me=  T-1:00 p.m.----Swallowed 5-MeO-AMT capsule",
  "Mr. E=  T-3:00 p.m.----Swallowed 5-MeO-AMT capsule",
  "I had to go to school at 1:10 p.m., and after researching all the info on it that I could find, I read that it usually begins to come on in 1.5-2 hrs. after consumption, and figured that by the time I got out of school (3:00 p.m.) it would begin kicking in. I was a little off in the timing, for it began while I was sitting in class (2:20 p.m). The oncoming feelings I had were purely physical, for the most part, I wanted to get up and begin running around the room. I had an increase in energy, and that by sitting and doing schoolwork made me feel anxious to leave. Scool let out, were I quickly unlocked my bike and began to speedily peddle it to my friends house, who I will call Mrs. S. She knew what I was doing, When I had taken it, and that if anything bad happened to me that she should call for help.",
  "I was very talkitive, and wanted to see what Mr.E was up to, so I gave him a cal and had him come over. He came with someone I'll name Mr.B , who will be our driver for the night. He came over at 3:40 p.m. I read that 5-Meo-AMT causes upset stomachs and the runs, but I never  felt like pukeing, but Mr.E did. We both experienced the runs, though. Mr.E took about a half hour of dry heaving, but never threw up.",
  "Me=  T-5:15 pm----Began Peaking",
  "My visuals mainly consisted of geometrical shapes being distorted.The brick walls were swimming like water, if I touched the bricks,then it would begin rippleing, as if the bricks were water and my finger was a raindrop. Laying on my back in the grass while staring at the clouds was by far the most beautifull thing I have ever seen. Clouds move with the wind (of course) but to me it seemed that they were moving away from me, as if i was the center of the 'thing' they were moving away from. The trees do not yet have leaves on them, and the emptuy branches began forming into a solid mass of wood,  or a ball of wood atop the trunk. We all then smoked 2 joints, which heavily increased the visualizations. I closed my eyes to see if i could receive CEV's, but to no prevail.",
  "I had to use the b-room, #2, so  went in and sat down to the worst and odd diarreah I've ever had. Mrs.S's shower stall was covered in tiles, and if i focused on one vertical line of tiles that the rest would 'gather' towards that set. Then the individual sets (vertically) would move up and down fluidly. I can't really explain it. After my mainly gassy outbursts, I went back outside to join the group. I felt mentally more aware of each individual's psyche, and examined their reactions to what was being said to them. I felt like I was beginning to understand human reactions due to communication, that it was a massive formula to manipulate, understand, and make more human relatinships. Ironically, as I grew to understand this, the less I talked. I began to tell myself that the more analytical I became to understand something, the more detached I became to what it Truly meant, that there's a line between fully understanding and over understanding, and that it could be applied to any subject.",
  "I decided that after I told myself this, that  I should try to find my 'line'. I did so by conversating and not thinking about it. Rather deep. Mrs.S had to work, so we left at 7pm. Mr.E began peaking then. We went to a wooded area near one of our schools, sitting on a fallen tree, and smoked another joint. Mr.E reported to us that everything in the forest was green and was giving off a green hue to everything, including us - our clothes, faces,etc. He said that he could 'feel' the forest. After saying that, I knew what he was talking about, because the tree I was sitting on began to 'speak' to me, telling me of how it is to grow. I was given my first ever CEV, by it, and I was shown how the tree came to be and showed me it's life over the years. I saw it growing ultra-fast, like the  still photos of fruit deacaying, and showed me how it fell. It was struck by lightning, and when I was shown that experience of lightning striking it, I felt the electricity run through my body. Tingling, god the tingling. I felt like  my cells were being given a jolt of high energy, all focused in on  the sensation.",
  "I was interuppted by Mr.B (not on 5-MeO-AMT) who was carrying a large stick-log and accidentally hit me in the head with it. From there on out was the worst f-ing migraine in the world. My 'trip' ( I call it soul-journeys) then ended, and I ws immersed into headache world from 8pm-2am. Over all, I would recommend this substance for spiritual use, not for 'fun', and definetely not to those who can't handle being detached from reality or aren't somewhat mentally grounded.  It was  enjoyable for me, with hardly any negative physical effects.</p>"
