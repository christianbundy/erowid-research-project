  "<p>I have done ecstasy over 30 times in my life and I am only 15. My first time was amazing! I tried it for the first time when I was 13 and I loved it. So, I kept doing it. But, after about 10 times, I couldn't get that rolling feeling anymore. I would feel good and have all the side effects of a good ecstasy pill but I still couldn't get that good old fashion roll. So all it is right now is a waste of money. But the question is, if it doesn't give me the high I want, why do I keep doing it? They say ecstasy isn't addictive, but I struggle with this problem everyday. I can't go one day without thinking about it. Pretty much everything triggers me. And when these triggers interact with me, I get these REALLY INTENSE cravings and I just can't seem to fight them. It is extremely hard. To tell you the truth, it's not worth it...</p>"
