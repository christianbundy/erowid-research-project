 "report": "<p>Well I have done amt many times and since it is now scheduled I decided to try 5-meo-amt. I ordered 1g from a well known supplier and had it before the weekend. Luckily my friend has a scale and we split the entire gram up into 5mg doses and stored them in foil. On friday night at around 7:30pm I take 5mg. I walk to a local meeting place where many people hang out. I start talking to a few of my friends while waiting for it to kick in.</p><p>8:00pm fri: I start to feel the effects but slightly. Colors seem slightly brighter but not much.</p><p>9:00pm fri: I leave where I was at and go for a walk. I have a good body buzz but still not much visuals.</p><p>10:30pm fri: I end up at my friend P's house. Still have a good body buzz going but visuals just weren't there yet. I decide to take another 5mg dose. My friend J was there and was deciding on to get mdma or not. I wanted some so we got pills. I got 2 @'s which we checked up on some sites.</p><p>11:30pm fri: Visuals now starting to kick in really good. More colorful then amt.</p><p>12:00am sat: Pills get here and I take one. Visuals are great now. Very intense color patterns swirling on everything I look at. Almost like the moon outside is randomly changing colors.</p><p>1:00am sat: Was disappointed with the e. My friend J took it and is rolling good but I don't feel it very much at all. I did give me a different body buzz which I liked but it wasn't that much. Possibly the 5-meo-amt might of just been overpowering to the pill. 2 more of my friends arrive with beer and some weed. I smoke a little which just increased my peak even more. We were upstairs listening to music and checking out some winamp visual plugins. They were amazing. It felt like I was being sucked into the pit of color. The visuals would almost leave the screen and seem to wrap around the room.</p><p>4:00am sat: Still have good visuals now and one of my friend's decides to go home (didnt take any drugs). I decide to take my other pill now.</p><p>4:45am sat: We go outside for a bit. On the way back, I started feeling the mdma really hard. I got so much energy and the 'love' feeling. Felt like I took some of the best e I have had in a couple years now. At this point I felt so great, the visuals were still very good and now I am rolling really hard.</p><p>5:30am sat: I am still rolling hard yet and the visuals have not gone away any bit. We head out to my friend M's house to hang out awhile. When we got out there my friend J wanted to try some 5-meo-amt so I gave him 2 5mg doses. He ate both of them and we sat down on a couch to chill for awhile.</p><p>6:00am sat: Friend J isn't feeling good so we get a ride back to P's house. I am still rolling and tripping good yet.</p><p>8:00am sat: J is not feeling good at all. Thinks just overdosed and he leaves to his mom's house.</p><p>9:00am sat: Me and my friend P are sitting around playing some madden 03 football. My visuals are still good yet but the rolling is starting to wear off now. We are sitting around waiting to hear from J to see how he is.</p><p>10:30am sat: Still at P's house and still tripping yet. Smoke a few bowls which really kick the trip back in. Still haven't heard anything about J yet.</p><p>12:00pm sat: J ended up going to the hospital and they have him sedated.</p><p>3:00pm sat: Still somewhat tripping, seems whenever I smoke some weed it kicks it right back in.</p><p>6:00pm sat: Friend D comes over to P's house. We started talking and  decided to trip some more. I gave D a 5mg dose and I took another 5mg dose.</p><p>6:30pm sat: D is puking a lot.</p><p>7:00pm sat: Me and D are starting to trip good now. Been smoking a lot of weed which has helped a lot.</p><p>8:30pm sat: A bunch of people come over and I have no idea who they are but they end up tripping with us too on 5-meo-amt.</p><p>9:30pm sat: C stops by and is extremely drunk. He pops 4 of these perscription sleeping pills while here. We offered him some 5-meo-amt so he said ok. We mixed 5mg with a line of K and he sniffed that. I am tripping really good now, the visuals were like last nite.</p><p>10:30pm sat: C is talking a who bunch of jiberish and is doing some really strange things. I think he just completely left reality for now. My visuals now are more intense then what they were last nite. So many swirling colors everywhere I look. I still haven't slept yet but I am not tired at all.</p><p>2:00am sun: We go out for a walk and it is amazing outside. The entire sky is just moving with colors. The snow seems to be made up of multicolored crystals.</p><p>3:30am: everyone leaving now and I decide to go home. I call a taxi cause I am exhausted and can barely walk. Once I get to my house I don't have my keys with and I am locked out, tripping really hard, and very tired. So now I have to walk back to P's house.</p><p>4:30am sun: I finally get back to P's house and D is still here tripping. We each decide to do another 5mg of 5-meo-amt.</p><p>5:00am sun: I am not tired anymore and am tripping hard again. We go play some madden football. Trying to play with snow on the ground is extremely hard. It was like the ground was constantly morphing, swirling, melting, and randomly changing colors.</p><p>9:00am sun: I am STILL tripping yet and I have forgot what being sober was like. P wakes up and we smoke some more weed.</p><p>10:00am sun: P decides he wanted to try some. He didn't do any drugs the entire weekend except smoke some weed. I give him 5mg and he takes it.</p><p>11:00am sun: We all go for a walk around town.  Its warm out today and it feels good to get up and move around. I am still tripping now and just waiting for it to wear off so I can sleep. I wish I hadn't take that other dose because my body is so tired now.</p><p>12:00pm sun: J got back from the hospital. He is ok now. He decided to never do drugs again which is a good thing. I should of never gave him the 2 5mg doses but at the time I just wasn't thinking.</p><p>1:00pm sun: I decide to go home this time. I call a taxi and head home. Still tripping yet...</p><p>2:00pm sun: Home now and got a shower. Go to use my computer but that is impossible. Its like I can't think at all. My brain just isn't functioning at all. My computer runs on linux and just looking at the terminal I would draw a blank. I go turn the tv on and watch a little bit of arena football. Thoughts are running through my mind and I can't control it at all. I am starting to get depressed and feel like I am going to lose complete control of myself.</p><p>3:00pm sun: I call my ex-gf T. I needed someone to comfort me cause I couldn't handle this 'mind fuck' anymore. I can't sleep yet and I don't know what to do. She gets scared and wants to meet with me right away. I meet her halfway to her house. We starting talking and I told her what I did this weekend. The feelings I am getting now are intensifiying now. I am so depressed yet I just want to flip out and kill someone or myself. I have never felt this way in my entire life and I don't know how to control it. I am still tripping yet just wishing for it to go away. I was thinking about taking some kind of opiates to put myself to sleep but choose not too.</p><p>5pm sun: I am still tripping and still with T. She is trying to comfort me and it is helping a little. I still feel like I am right on the edge and scared if I were to cross it. What is really bothering me is occasionaly I hear voices. I look around and nobody is there. I think this could be from the sleep I haven't had since thursday night and all the 5-meo-amt I have taken.</p><p>5:30pm sun: Me and T are sitting on this bench by this parking lot.  I am still tripping yet but I can tell it is slowly starting to wear off now. My brain is still completely thrashed. I know I need sleep and I plan on sleeping as soon as my mind lets me.</p><p>6:00pm sun: We start walking back to her house now since it is getting dark out. While we were walking along the road a car full of hs kids drives by and yells something at T. That pushed me over the edge there. I flipout. I start screaming at them and they pull over ahead of us. I take my jacket off and start sprinting towards their car. The kid on the passenger side starts getting out. While he was stepping out I grabbed and dug my fingers into his throat as hard as I could and continued to punch him in his head. I kept telling him he is going to die looking at my face. The driver slammed on the gas while I was standing at the side of the car hitting the passenger. The car flew forward and hit my left arm that was holding the passenger. I let go right away. The metal column that is in the middle of the car hit my elbow and I almost thought I broke my arm. T is screaming and crying because of what happened. I am a nonviolent person and that was the first time in my life I have ever lashed out like that. I have no idea what caused it.</p><p>6:30pm sun: We are back at T's house and I am laying on her couch. I am not sure what is causing this but I feel like I am being poked with pins all over my body. It was happening throughout the day but it was getting worse now. I am worried that I might have damaged my central neverous system because this never happened to me before. I start drinking plenty of water to see if I can help with flushing my system out. My arm hurts now from where the car hit me but at least I didn't break any bones.</p><p>10:00pm sun: I finally fall asleep. I didn't sleep as long as I expected. I woke up on monday at 9:30am. Felt very tired and worn out but it felt so good to be sober again. I am still depressed now but not as bad as I was on sunday. I can actually think now which feels so good.</p><p>I don't recommend what I did this past weekend to anyone. It was very stupid what I did and I have no reason for doing it. I was very scared at times when I thought I might have permanantely damaged my brain. Actually I still don't know if I did or not. It is now wednesday and I can think clear and my memory seems fine so if I am lucky I didn't do any damage.</p>",
