 "report": "<p>NOTE:</p><p>I am not in anyway, shape, or form a spiritualist. My use of entheogens and other mind altering substances is strictly recreational. I am not trying to achieve a higher state of mind, nor am I attempting to discover 'god(s)'. Simply, I find the use of psychotropic substances to be an interesting and safe way to spend an afternoon.</p><p>The setting was my apartment on a lazy fall Saturday. After my girlfriend left for work, I went to the gym for a light workout. I find that keeping my body in good condition and the healthy dose of endorphins offers better highs, trips, and experiences with these substances. After working out, I drank two glasses of water with lemon.</p><p>It would also be wise to note that when I use any entheogen, I fast for the 12-24 hours before dosing. The last thing I had to eat was salmon around 6pm the night prior. I dosed the Cannabis and Kratom around 1pm.</p><p>I went in the living room, layed on my back, and closed my eyes for a while. After a short nap, I went into the kitchen and cooked 1 gram of Cannabis in olive oil for 10 minutes, let the oil cool for a moment, then I drank the resulting 'bud oil'. I chased it with another glass of water and lemon.</p><p>I then threw some laundry in the dryer and began preparing the Kratom. I put the kettle on to boil while I placed 2 grams of 10x Kratom extract in gelcaps. After the kettle whistled I put another gram of Kratom in a coffee mug and poured the hot water in the mug. I swallowed the gelcaps while I waited for the Kratom tea to cool. After stirring the tea for a while I placed an ice cube in the tea and drank it slowly. I then went into my bedroom and layed down for a while.</p><p>20 minutes after consuming the cannabis and ten minutes after consuming the Kratom I began to feel a little drowsy. This is not surprising since I've found that with my biochemistry, cannabis and some stimulants (caffeine, nicotine, etc.) cause me to become mildly lethargic. A few minutes later, I even felt sleepy.</p><p>I closed my eyes, and for the next 15-20 minutes I slowly felt the Kratom come alive. It started with an overwhelming feeling of indifference: I didn't feel like getting up to fold the laundry. Even though I wanted to, I couldn't rouse myself to get up and drink the remaining gram of Kratom.</p><p>I simply layed on the bed letting my mind wander for an hour. I had trouble keeping my eyes open, but I never fell asleep. I was so content being lazy and useless, I can only imagine that this is what those Chinamen in opium dens felt like. I could see myself (if I had a steady supply) laying in bed, doing nothing but eating Kratom and watching my beard and nails grow. The Kratom/Cannabis combination provided a very strong body high.</p><p>When I finally did get up to fold the laundry and get more tea, I found it somewhat difficult to walk and maneuver myself around the apartment. I put the kettle on again and folded the laundry. As I did so, I drew up a bath. I then made some tea with the remaining 1 gram of Kratom and took the kettle into the bath with me to get the water extra hot (I take very hot baths/showers). I then sipped the Kratom tea while I sat in the bath.</p><p>Although the combination of eaten Cannabis, Kratom, and a warm bath was one of ineffable bliss, I wouldn't recommend it. I began to slip into an almost sleep/dreamlike state, and if I would have slipped under the water, I don't know that I would have made any effort to pull myself out. My body was enjoying a throbbing warmth that lasted long after the bath water had lost its temperature. I stayed in this stupor for almost an hour before I 'came to' and realized how long I'd been in the tub and 'out of it'. It was wonderful. I couldn't help thinking of the Euphio Question, a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, in which a group of people experience a state of bliss so strong, they don't even notice that two days have passed and they are freezing to death.</p><p>I, with pruned fingers and droopy eyelids, stagger out of the tub and dry off. I then get in my car and go to visit my folks. At this point I've come down for the most part and I find I'm a little foggy cognitively. Driving probably wasn't a good idea, and meeting parental figures for dinner might have been a bad idea as well. Although I feel a little foggy, I also find I can't shut up and I talk extensively with my folks about everything. My mother even asks if I'm drinking caffeine again.</p><p>Overall I find the Cannabis Kratom experience to be very favorable. I just ordered some more Kratom and I think I will do a smaller dose next time (probably stick with 2 grams of the 10x). For those who are looking for an opiate like experience, I can't help you because I have never done opiates before. The closest thing to what I experienced on the mental level was when I was on a demerol drip, but demerol didn't have the body high this experience did.</p>",
