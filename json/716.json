  "5-MeO-DMT  I would never have believed it had it not happened to me personally. Ive had out-of-body experiences before with ketamine and again with some particularly potent weed I smoked in Amsterdam, but none of these were to prepare me for where the MeO would take me.  I am grateful now that I bothered to read up on the past experiences of others who have used 5-MeO-DMT.",
  "I bought 10mg of MeO and was advised to take only 5mg for my first dose.  It came as tiny, white crystals and was relatively easy to split in half although I have to admit to being more than a bit skeptical when I saw the actual  amount of crystal that was sitting  in my glass pipe.  Being used to dealing with grams of material and pills usually, this was a totally new experience for me. But as they say... size is not everything!  That sentiment will never be proved more correct than this particular example.",
  "My bedroom was to be the place where I would begin my journey.  It was familiar and uncluttered, warm and small, covered with quilts and pillows and with a little, background music on. After talking over the potentialities it was time to relax and clear my mind in silence for 15 minutes.  I was now ready.  I was also advised to have a sitter present with me for my first time using this particular chemical.  A fellow medicinal traveler had agreed to be there incase I needed any help while under the influence.",
  "The base of the pipe was heated with a blow-torch cigarette lighter.  I had previously tried to use a normal flame lighter but all that happened was the glass bulb turned black and the temperature wasnt high enough or the heat concentrated enough to properly vaporize the crystals.  This time was different.  My sitter plugged the hole in the pipe and started to heat the 5-MeO-DMT.  I lay back on a mattress, holding the pipe in one hand until I could see the white smoke appearing.  5-MeO-DMT first melts to a clear liquid then with further heating starts the process of vaporization.  There isnt much smoke at all from 5mg, again, lulling you into a very false sense of security.  I unplugged the hole and breathed in fully, feeling the warm vapour gently flow down to my lungs.",
  "My heart was beating a little faster than usual:  I was excited and nervous.  Its a weird feeling as the effect starts to overpower you.  I felt like my head was being surrounded by needle-like probes, rapidly pushing through my skull and into the dark recesses of my mind.  At that point my sitter took away the pipe, I pulled down the blindfold from the top of my head to cover my eyes and lay down on the mattress. ",
  "I was completely motionless almost immediately... blissfully lost in infinity.  I felt like my body was deflating, my essence was being sucked from it.  At the same time, swirling patterns of shades of blue were occupying my minds eye, just how I imagined the beginning of the Cosmos, that elusive primordial soup, to look like... I  was being returned to that space and time.",
  "As the rest of my surroundings disappeared and ceased to register with what was left of my body without me in it, I could feel myself  (the word myself here is used not to describe me  my body and who I am in relation to the rest of the visible, material world that we all exist and interact in  but what is behind all of that...the driving force, the pilot guiding us, the controller of our own personal astronaut suit; my essence, my soul, my spirit, whatever you want to call it) being  assimilated into everything that exists outside of this 3-d construct.  I was being made one with the Cosmos and it was being made one with me.  I could feel the sensation of traveling through space of some sort but without having any form; moving in all directions simultaneously but yet just merely being.  I had no purpose, I had no shell, I had no direction, I had no vision, I just was.",
  "It gave me a wonderfully enriching awareness to know this, to be shown this.  I feel like I am not alone out there, that once I leave this tactile world, I am an indistinguishable part of everything.  My essence permeates places that I didnt know existed or maybe didnt believe existed.  Its hard not to believe that everything is connected, or can be connected by a force greater than us pathetic, mortal humans after you journey to these places.  It felt safe out theremuch safer than here.",
  "After 11 minutes the process started to reverse, almost as if Id now learned what I needed to learn in order for me to move forward in my quest to the next levels.  I was slowly returned to my body, gently and effortlessly.  This particular voyage was over but the start of something bigger was just beginning.",
  "After a period of about 15 minutes relaxing and getting my head around what had just happened to me I was able to stand up and move around, completely unaffected by the 5-MeO-DMTwell, in body anyway.",
  "Thankfully my mind has been irrevocably changed for the better.",
