  "Well one night I was chilling with my closest friends when we decieded to do methadone, they had all done it before, but it was a first for me so I decieded to swallow it opposed to snorting it like they did...",
  "40 minutes passed and I got kinda weak and sank into the couch...",
  "60 minutes passes and I noticed that if I even moved the slightest inch I felt naseous...at this point I was disappointed, ALL I felt was sick and weak, no euphoric feeling, no lightheadedness, nothing, just sick...",
  "later we went for a drive to get something, I felt so sick I don't remember what the hell it even was, except that I sat in the back seat cuddled up to my friend thinking that maybe if I just stayed as still as possible I might not puke all over his car...",
  "I don't know how, but we somehow made it back to his house where we curled up on the couch and assumed the same position (the less I move the better chance I have of barfing everywhere)...",
  "hours passed and I still wasn't feeling any better, but I had to go home....the second I stood up to leave EVERYTHING in my stomach came up....I've never puked so much or so hard in my life (not to mention that whatever it was was bright green)...but I had to admit that after throwing up I felt a little better, at least enough to drive home...made it home and into bed thinking I would wake up in the morning and at least feel a little better....god was I wrong",
  "I woke up and felt 100 times worse! to make a long story short I felt like a fucking crack addict! I would sweat to the point where my bed was soaked and feel like I was on fire then 10 minutes later be so cold that I was uncontrollably shivering.....this went on for the next 24 hours where I managed to throw up till there wasn't anything left in my stomach then drive heave for HOURS!!!!",
  "at one point it was so bad that I really considered calling 911, never in my life (and I've done a lot of drugs) had I felt like this before.."
