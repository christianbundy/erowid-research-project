 "report": "<p>i have had an interest in peyote since i've started heavy usage of psychedelics. I'm pretty experienced with lsd and mushrooms, but never tried pure mescaline. anyway, i was looking for salvia discounts on the net when i found that they were selling san pedro. i was VERY familiar with that name and researched that cactus. i was ecstatic when i found out it's like peyote. so i ordered 12 inches and had it delivered to my job.</p><p>the day after i lost said job, i decided to cook it. i chopped, diced, and blended it with water before cooking. i let it boil for about 3 hours until there was about 12 to 16 ounces of goop at the bottom. i then strained it thru a t-shirt. what was left was a putrid smelling potion. i refrigerated it for two days.</p><p>the night that i took it, i was planning to go to a rave. i couldn't find a ride so i decided against the party, which was a really good idea. i drank the potion over the course of 45 minutes by taking a shot glass full every 5 - 10 minutes and chased it with orange soda. boy i tell you... it's an absolutely wretched tasting concoction. as soon as i finished, i started feeling weird from the get go. it was a weird warp in my body and it remained that way for the rest of the night.</p><p>about an hour later, i was getting uncomfortable on my couch and decided i should go puke to feel better. all i did was look at the toilet wrong and i immediately began to call Earl. my vomit looked very trippy. when i finished i took a good look at my face in the mirror and noticed that the corners of the bathroom were stretching and moving about. i then went to my couch to watch tv and couldn't really pay attention because i was so distracted by the furniture moving around. it was great seeing all that motion. it wasn't fluttering, melting, or breathing like on acid or shrooms, but the furniture were literally moving without distortion to shape. i then felt that i should turn off the lights and TV, and light up a candle. i sat in front of the candle in the dark and began to stare. i then noticed my indian spirit on the opposite side. i couldn't see him completely, but i noticed the contour of his face and his eyes were bright. being that im into Santeria, i've figured out that one of my spirits was an indian warrior. seeing him in front of me reassured me that i can conquer any intimidation.</p><p>i then got up and went for a walk in my neighborhood. i noticed a car had a jesus license plate. i then shouted aloud, 'it ain't about jesus, it's all about GOD!' (By the way this was at 1 AM in the ghetto.)</p><p>when i returned home, there is a long hallway in my apt. building that i have to walk thru. the floor was very wavy and the end of the hallway appeared to be moving towards me then away. i thought this was hella cool so i decided to walk from the beginning of the hallway all over again. when i got inside, i sat in my room for an hour meditating. i could see eyes everywhere. there were about 6 pair of eyes in my room. those were the eyes of the spirits in my room that were trying to interrupt my meditation. it was really hard trying to focus, especially with the one spirit with the red eyes. he was a real scary motherfucker, but eventually i shut em all out and discovered how very lonely of a person i really am. i also discovered that i love my mother very much and should make more of an initiative to show her how much i care for her.</p><p>i got up and noticed that i was getting strobe vision. there was a lapse in time between each movement. as if my mind were turning on and off. VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY weird. on a scale of 1 - 10 of how weird that was... that was a 13 squared folks. serious weird shit was happening.</p><p>thas when i decided that i should go smoke some weed to calm down a bit. smoking weed when im on acid or shrooms makes me calm down and relax. well, apparently it's the opposite with mescaline. weed just made my trip a whole lot more intense. that one hit of hi-grade weed just took me to the next level. at this point i was cursing the TV out cuz there were no cartoons on at that time. i was psychomumbling random thoughts and wishing i had a person there with me. i tried listening to some drum n bass but found out that it was WAY too mean for me at that time. i needed some trance but didn't have any. i spent the rest of the peak huddled on the couch with my pillow and bedspread. one thing i discovered was that i was here and there at the same exact time. here meaning that i was in somewhat control over my body, and there meaning i was tripping motherfucken balls.</p><p>when i came off my plateau, i decided i was sane enough to have some type of communication with the outside world thru the internet. i spoke with a couple of lovers. and at about 5 AM i took some tylenol pm to go to sleep. i fell asleep about 30 minutes later.</p><p>somewhere along the peak, i made the decision to never drink the concoction because the trip was way too weird and the potion way too putrid. but now that im sober, i'll probably succumb to buying it again, but vowing to extract the mescaline and putting it in capsules.</p><p>im just glad that i finally have mescaline under my belt. i would only recommend it to experienced 'trippers.' be very careful, mescaline can snap you in two like a toothpick.</p><p>this drug is a definite ego shaterer. i felt that type of sensation slightly on a real high dose of mushrooms, but not that intensity i felt on mescaline. mescaline is a completely different animal in every way. i probably would use the san pedro again in the future, but this time with people and the right music.</p>",
