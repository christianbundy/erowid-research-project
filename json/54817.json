 "report": "<p>I had a grand mal seizure and was prescribed dilantin, I was sent home with a 'loading dose' of 900mg and was to continue taking 300mg each day. I am quite fond of getting high off my prescriptions so i decided to take all 900mg at once which didn't seem too dangerous as I was supposed to take them at 2 hour intervals. Sadly to say this was a bad idea. I don't remember a whole lot after this but I guess I took 30 more. I guess by the time I realized what I had done it was already in my blood stream.</p><p>I remember going to sleep and waking up and thinking i was dead, i believed this for a week and hallucinated, was in the hospital for three days don't remember it at all. If anybody thinks this a good drug to get high on.. think again, its dangerous in even its normal doses, I now have parkinson's disease because of it. this is messed up stuff!</p>",
