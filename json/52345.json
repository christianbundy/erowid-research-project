 "report": "<p>Set/Setting: Evening around 10 past 10. Optimistic but anxious</p><p>Method: Three seeds crushed and basified with baking soda to a fine powder then dried under a lamp for 10 minutes. Snorted all at once in both nostrils. Jesus. It tasted god awful and had a terrible burn. The drip was also disgusting and made me want to gag. The taste seemed to remain for a majority of the time. After 2 minutes I felt stupid cause nothing happened then WHAM!</p><p>I peaked like a son of a bitch and the vertigo was insane. I went immediately from my chair to lay down on the couch. After another 30 seconds I felt real dizzy with some slight head pressure so I got up to get a drink and realized I needed to re-route to the bathroom. Didn't quite make it to the toilet (missed by 6 inches) and did a little porcelain praying. Sat there for a little while longer, still not tripping, just feeling euphoric and ill. The ill overpowered the euphoria, and composed of mostly head pressure and dizziness. I started to panic a little because my research described visuals but I just felt sick. I talked myself down reminding myself that I did not take a lethal dosage and that no matter how bad it was it would go away. I soon became calm again.</p><p>The vertigo was still unbearable and the light was a little to harsh so I went to my room with the light off and shut the door. Instantly I started to panic so I opened the door again. My fear of the dark was inexplicable. I laid down and felt really hot so I took off all of my clothes and laid there for a while. Then I started to notice some odd things. The hallucinations were mild but somehow intense. No color differentials but there were no shadows anymore and VERY high contrast in everything. Everything I looked at was blocky and a single solid color. No gradients at all. I laid there for a while and realized I couldn't keep track of time so with some effort, fighting off the nausea, I got up and turned on Dark Side of the Moon. As the first track fired up I remember reading about intense close eyed visuals. I closed my eyes and saw nothing at first. I made note that I was indifferent to the music which I considered odd because I usually love the album on psychedelics.</p><p>Then visuals began to materialize. There were no colors but I could defiantly see shapes. The start looked like one of those old movies where the credit screen burned away from the city. The illness began to fade as I focused on the images. It was like I was standing on a sidewalk and these silhouettes were passing me by. I couldn't see them clearly but somehow I knew that they weren't human. One of them approached me and came closer to me. It was strange but I felt remarkably close to it emotionally, like a friend I hadn't seen in a long time. There was a longing to put my arms around them. Suffice to say being a simple closed eye hallucination this was impossible. Soon the images began to fade and I made more note of the room. I still felt a little nauseous and the music could no longer hold my attention.</p><p>I got up and felt the vertigo again, walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower. I let the water fall on me trying to keep the dizziness from forcing me to vomit. Soon I became bored with the shower and plugged the tub and switched to the tap to fill the bath. I laid back as the water ran and was a little confused because I still felt the shower hitting me on the chest. The tub was full and I put my head under the water and kept my mouth above the surface. 5 minutes passed and this time I saw a bright white light. I thought it might be coming from outside the curtain and checked. It blocked out the light so I went back underwater and tried to focus on the light. I had no control over what I saw. It was quite unlike LSD where focusing could produce results. I laid their watching the light blip come and go until the water felt cold. I got out and checked the clock. It had only been 15 minutes from the time I entered the shower until I got out of the bath. It had felt like much longer. The nausea had been reduced to a simple motion sickness feeling. The visuals were no longer present and I began to feel more relaxed. I cleared my sinuses of any remaining powder.</p><p>Approx 11:30</p><p>As the trip was for the most part over, save some afterglow, I began to review the experience in my head. I figured that I may have taken to much and that may explain the intense sickness. </p><p>Conclusion: Defiantly not a party drug</p>"
