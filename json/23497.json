 "report": "<p>Not to long ago I did DXM for, maybe, the third time. It was the most I had ever done. I drank a 12 0z. bottle of robetussin DM, taking my time and finishing it in about an hour. I felt the normal effects I felt before, but then something happened.</p><p>I don't exactly know what happened, but all of a sudden something was very different. My conciousness went to another level and I don't think I noticed for a long time because it had been like an hour after I finished the bottle that I felt this way. The lights were out and I couldn't see anything, but I could sense the room. I could sense two of me, two conciousnesses disconnected physically, but connected mentally. That's the only way I can describe it.</p><p>Then I was looking at myself from the ceiling, both of me, smoking a cigarette and twitching. I could see me going insane. I had a crazy expression on my face and I could just sense them (me) losing touch with reality. At the second I realized that there were now THREE of me, the two on the ground and the me watching them from above. I realized also, that one of the mes on the ground was a false me. I was convinced one of me was fake - an imitation. After a while I realized that there was only one me on the ground and that I just had double vision. After some point this went away and I was back in one body and on the ground.</p><p>After this I can't remember clearly. Remembering it now, is like remembering a dream you just woke up from. When It wore off, I wasn't even sure if any of it actually happened or if it really was a dream. the only other thing I remember distinctly is looking at my hand and arm. It looked like I was very far away from it, sort of like looking through the wrong end of binoculars. Any way, I didn't recognize it as my own. I had a hard time even believing that it was real, but I could feel with it and move it so it had to be mine!</p><p>Robo has been a big inspiration for me in my music and writing, which is why I use drugs in the first place. When it comes to drugs used for purposes of creativity, robo may not make my music all that interesting (as I've learned from previous trips), but it is great to reflect on.</p>",
