 "report": "<p>I'd always been interested in TMA-2, its been on the top of my list of RC's to sample for awhile, so when i came into 200mg i was stoked. It is very chemically similar to mescaline, however my interest stemmed from working with an extract of acorus gramineus last year. It gives a very nice intoxication, strange body high and very spacy, but no loss of energy. everything is slightly shiny and more defined, and I get a strong sense of 'awe and wonder' like I get from psychs but without all the other traditional psychedelic effects.</p><p>From PiKHAL;</p><p>'The 2,4,5-trimethoxy pattern. There is an essential oil called asarone that is 2,4,5-trimethoxy-1-propenylbenzene. It is the trans- or alpha-isomer, and the cis-isomer is known as beta-asarone. It is the isomerization analogue of the much more rare 1-allyl-2,4,5-trimethoxybenzene, gamma-asarone, or euasarone, or sekishone. Asarone is the major component of Oil of Calamus obtained from the rhizomes of Acorus calamus, the common Sweet Flag that grows wild on the edges of swamps throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. It has been used as a flavoring of liqueurs and, as almost every other plant known to man, has been used as a medicine. In fact, in Manitoba this plant was called Rat-root by the Cree Indians in the Lake Winnipeg area known as New Iceland, and Indian-root by the Icelandic pioneers. It was used externally for the treatment of wounds, and internally for most illnesses. There apparently is no report of central effects. The corresponding propanone, acoramone (or 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetone), is also present in Oil of Calamus. The styrene that corresponds to asarone is found in a number of plants, and is surprisingly toxic to brine shrimp. The older literature describes an allyl-trimethoxy benzene called calamol, but it has never been pinned down as to structure. The isolation of gamma-asarone or euasarone from Oil of Xixin (from wild ginger) has given rise to a potential problem of nomenclature. One of the Genus names associated with wild ginger is Asiasarum which looks very much like the name asarone, which comes from the Genus Acorus. And a second Genus of medical plants also called wild ginger is simply called Asarum. There is an Asarum forbesi from central China, and it is known to give a pleasant smell to the body. And there is Asarum seiboldi which is largely from Korea and Manchuria. It has many medical uses, including the treatment of deafness, epilepsy, and rheumatism. The amphetamine that would arise from this natural treasure chest is TMA-2.'</p><p>Now shulgin mentions no activity from acorus spp., but I have direct experience that says the material is VERY psychoactive, however only when fresh.</p><p>So the other night I swallowed 35mg of TMA-2 wrapped in a tiny bit of napkin. within a half an hour I could feel differences in my body...slightly numbed, and it feels bigger. or perhaps like I am hyper aware of my aura. feels like mescaline only the body high with mescaline involves lots of motion and energy. this is very stationary and somehow stranger and more offputting.</p><p>During the next hour I continued to get slightly higher, but extremely nauseous. it got to the point where I was considering not using the material again because I was so uncomfortable. Waaaaay more nauseating than my last trip on 400mg mesc hcl, and still slightly more, or perhaps the same, as what Ive gotten from whole cactus. At the 1.5 - 2 hour mark the TMA-2 began to take hold. At the 1.5 hour mark I smoked a bowl on my deck, this was very good.</p><p>I noticed this only during smoking pot, but it has a slight MDMA like feel to it. where I sleepily sink into my couch, and there is a deep feeling of contentment. Make no mistake it had none of the EUPHORIA of molly, just the CONTENTMENT. Visually it was very light. only a small handful of times did I notice any patterning or morphing, and even then it was very mild. Lights were great however. The light from my neighbors house coming through the fence was captivating. they all twinkle beautifully.</p><p>The body high I described earlier only gets stronger and weirder. I just feel numb, and larger. just like what I get from mescaline except no moving energies, or certain parts of my body feeling stranger than others. very solitary and uniform.</p><p>The drug is pure sex. Ive never been hornier during a trip in my entire life. I think I must have spent at least two hours watching porn. Orgasm is not as intense as it can be on other drugs(has anyone here ever stuck it out long enough to come on oxycontin? its fucking great), but the orgasm isnt what feels the best. just being there, in that mindset and teasing my head was far better than the actual climax. I hear alot, especially from RC users, on which psychs are best of the erotic, several people claim as being good for this, like 2c-b, and found nothing compared to TMA-2.</p><p>I did not really do anything or have any effects worthy of writing a trip report on, it was just me sitting at home taking the chem for a test run...I never try something for the first time outside my home... but I wanted to start a thread on it, this is a VERY interesting chemical. It feels so similar to mescaline you wouldnt believe it...however I have only a few mesc trips under my belt so perhaps my comparison is superficial. It does have a more 'crunchy' type high, a little more bodyload. But it has the same sleepiness, the same gentle demeanor, just the same basic headspace. like I said 35mg was a bit of an undershot though. Next time I will try 45mg and hopefully see if it has any similar potential for meaningful experiences that mescaline has.</p>",
