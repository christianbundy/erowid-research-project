 "report": "<p>So it started out when I got a half oz of booms from a buddy of mine, for free. So I thought to myself, hey I'm gunna trip for the next few days, sounds like fun, right? Wrong. Yes I did have a fantastic trip the first day when I took 3.5 grams and then 3.0 grams 4 hours after that. But then I thought that the next day would also be a fun day to trip, I took 4 grams the next day and did not get a single effect, nothing at all, total waste of booms, my pupils didn't even diolate at all. I took some vit. c. still nothing. It was a total waste and I couldn't believe how stupid I was for doing that.</p>",
