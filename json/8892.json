  "This report is an attempt to describe the beneficial effects of the drug LSA, and how I've accidentally found it to be an effective way of temporarily banishing schizophrenia (in one case, up to a week). Not a pleasent way, but a way nevertheless.",
  "It started when a friend/semi-roommate and I bought a large quanity of baby hawaiian woodrose seeds from a Hawaiian supplier. We decided to make a crude extraction, with (cleanly evaporating) camp fuel, and isopropyl alcohol. I won't go into that here, because this extraction is talked about in great detail elsewhere.",
  "The first time I took it, it was to calibrate the dose. I had fun standing around in the desert, tripping, enjoying the music at a party I probably shouldn't have been at. Everyone was relaxed and nice to talk to though, and didn't care, so I didn't either. At a low dose it was euphoric, mildly visual.",
  "But the time that its interaction with schizophrenia really became apparent was at a huge electronic music festival. People wandered around decked out in beads, funny pants, and other memorabilia from an unfortunately dead age. Some of the worlds best DJs were playing phat music, ripping through crowds of dancers. It started earlier in the day. I had 3 capsules of unextracted, ground, defatted seeds (~30-40 seeds?). In retrospect this was WAY too much for this kind of E-d out setting. But Infected Mushroom, the psitrance group, was proforming during the day, and I was DAMNED if I was going to see them sober. So I took the 3 capsules. My mind was unhinged within an hour. Far, far, too much. The music was amazing, and so was the nausea. Nausea with the seeds is much worse if I'm feeling self-concious, or otherwise bad about something. In the huge crowd of people I became unhinged. I started to become very delusional. I was convinced that people were watching me, and that the crowd in general gave a shit about what I was doing. At the same time I was very calm, LSA relaxes me physically. Questions like 'where do I sit down' became huge, 10 minutes of pondering type questions. Every mental disorder I had became blatantly obvious.",
  "I heard people talking about how visibly crazy I was, but, it was probably a hallucination. I wandered after my friends, taking their cue for everything. Despite all this, I was enjoying myself. The music was wonderful, the dancing was great, and I found that my muscles had relaxed and for the first time in my life I could liquid (sorta). At one point I spent around an hour sitting in the grass looking at the trees, the ravers, everyone and everything.",
  "What was interesting is when I started to come down. I was there with a friend and a roommate (who incidently had threatened to ditch me if I got too fucked up. Fortunetly they went back on this). What I started to notice coming down from this rather intense trip was that several things I had been convinced of in the preceding month just sort of melted away. I had been convinced that one of the two people I was with was planning on betraying me or screwing me over in some way. I don't remember how. As I came down, suddenly I started to have this feeling of clarity. I realized that no one was plotting against me. No one around me was watching me. All my paranoia and delusions kind of melted away, replaced by a sense of being clear headed. The auditory hallucinations (they usually sound like people in another apartment, or who are just out of sight - I do not suffer from visual hallucinations) disappeared, but I didn't notice, because - they weren't there. Suddenly all these things from the past month made sense in a calm, clear headed manner. I thought about this all while watching a huge metal flower belching flame.",
  "Schizophrenia in many people, like me, comes and goes. This was during a peak of delusional thought. After the trip I was completely sane and non-delusional for around a week. For another 3-4 days I was better than usual. It was a relief. It wasn't like taking an antipsychotic, which only dims the hallucinations and delusions. With LSA they were simply gone.",
  "In case anyone is immediately tempted to go try some - remember, I payed for it by being more crazy than usual for a short period of time. I have no idea whether this was idiosyncratic or not. And I took a very very high dose of LSA containing seeds. I was throwing up frequently. While I have since experienced this effect, I haven't had the nerve to take as much as I did at the electronic music festival. The constant nausea is a definite problem."
