 "report": "<p>Ok, before we start I must say I had my first LSD experience (the one I'm about to report) during a crazy drug orgy week, so when I dropped the acid I still had MDMA, methamphetamine, alcohol, poppers and lots of THC in my blood. I've been told the experience would be different if I were clean before dropping so I thought I'd point this out.</p><p>I put the blotter under my tongue at 9:30 pm and went for a bath. 30 minutes later I got out and my friends were already smoking joints so I smoked too. That's when I noticed the first effects. I said 'Hmm, this is not a regular joint'. The high felt clearer and more exciting. Like I knew something wonderful would happen.</p><p>Then we sat in our hotel beds, barely having time to take a rest because 10 min later the room was full with friendly strangers (well, it was a one week trip with only high school seniors from all over the country = crazyness). I felt very social and as the joints passed around I talked about how we were all the same point of energy and matter, back in the first moment of the Universe, and how we are still one. The new friends were all amazed, saying I was fucking their minds and that I should be a psychologist (O_o ??? they were only on hash and alcohol!).</p><p>Later a beautiful girl arrived and I flipped. I was playing with a glow stick in the dark when she walked in, then turned on the lights and couldn't help but saying 'You're a fairy!'. Her name was Ariana, and she indeed looked like a fairy. I remembered her from a dream I had as a child. Suddenly everything made sense and I saw all kind of signs everywhere leading to her. I offered her one blotter and she was thrilled. We hugged, and she smelled so good. I cried when she left, I thought she was my soul-mate and wanted to marry her.</p><p>Then, when everybody else left, I went to the beach with a friend who was also on acid. It was the highest moment. I was seeing shadows following me everywhere and when I looked at my friend he would morph into an evil clown or a zombie but surprisingly I didn't freak out. I felt in heaven and thought nothing could hurt me. The sand felt wonderful, the sea sounded so deep but the sky, oh, I felt like I was looking at the sky of heaven, the stars of heaven. I couldn't believe how cruel the 'real world' was and just wanted everyone to feel the same way I did, that same moment, the whole world on acid, one giant love rave, trance pumping everywhere, peace, love, unity, respect.</p><p>We went inside and I took off my shoes. Walking around barefoot felt sooo great. The we listened to some music and it all sounded different. Like behind the obvious notes everybody knew there were hidden sounds and lots of trance, like easter eggs specially made for people on acid to listen. That night I finally understood what trance was: the heart of music, pure essence. Trance is everywhere, from Sigur Ros to The Beatles, the nerves of the music, the root of the sound. When I listened to Lucy in the Sky it really hit home. I felt like I was Lucy herself. And I still do. Like there's a Lucy essence inside me and now I'm closer to it than ever before.</p><p>When I turned the lights off, it was magical. I felt under the sea. So peaceful. If I closed my eyes, lots of colored patterns, not so different from those I get when eating hash, just more vivid. My friend massaged me and I was one fucking universal orgasm. Talking about orgasms, I went outside and it was really cold but at the same time it felt like the perfect temperature. It felt orgasmically good to let the cold get under my skin. So I invented the 'Criosmic Orgasm' concept (crio = ice + cosmic).</p><p>So we were sitting there smoking joints when somehow I noticed we were smoking the same joint for like 40 minutes, and it lasted a full hour, I swear! I called it the 'joint battle' because the fucking little fellow wanted to burn forever.</p><p>Coming down was really smooth, I didn't even notice. Doing things was really complicated. Just going to the bathroom, ooooh, such lazyness. Our room was a mess but just thinking about cleaning it up was terrible. At about 10 am I fell asleep, then woke up at 3 pm. Getting dressed was funnier than ever (such crazy combos) and when we went outside, life seemed perfect. It sill does, 3 or 4 or 5 days later, can't remember (try to understand, I'm all burned out :P)</p>",
