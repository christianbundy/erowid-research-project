  "Kava is a very relaxing drug. It's surprising it's not more widely used socially. Perhaps if it had been selectively bred in the same way cannabis plants have been for a few centuries, you could get quite an impressive high from this plant. Sadly this isn't the case, but it's still very relaxing.",
  "I tried it a couple of times. The first time I simply took about 10 capsules (each containing 300mg of Kava root - no mention of lactones on the bottle). Quite relaxing. Pleasant. Not much more effect. Smoking a spliff, it seemed to enhance the effects of the pot.",
  "The setting is simply that I was sat at home. Exams finished a couple of weeks ago. I got my results back and was pleased with them. Now it's just a relaxing week or so till I go to get a job for most of summer. And FYI, I smoke pot moderately. I have done for the past week or so anyway. No medications or anything either.",
  "Anyway, for the next time I made up a little recipe:",
  "Contents of 35 Kava capsules (empty out the powder)",
  "1 tsp of cinnamon",
  "1 tsp of nutmeg",
  "1 tbsp of honey",
  "1 tbsp of golden granulated (unrefined) cane sugar",
  "5 cardamom pods",
  "1 pint of milk",
  "Mix the ingredients together in a pan and warm over a low heat, stirring occasionally, till milk is nice and hot. About 20 minutes should be fine.",
  "I'm going to try and experiment with this recipe. It may be nice with soy milk. Possibly, you could add some ground rice and turn it into a type of kheer (a traditional indian desert).",
  "Many people would probably hate this concoction, but I found it quite nice. Admittedly, it was a bit hard to taste - it numbed my taste buds a fair bit!",
  "Drinking this, I experienced a temporary numbing of the lips and mouth as I drank (lasting no more than a couple of minutes) and a pleasantly warm feeling in my stomach.",
  "Within the next half hour I found myself very relaxed. My arms felt heavy. My mind, working in a slower way. There's a little (extremely mild) visual distortion. Music sounds deeper. Colours look nicer.",
  "If you have either of them -- play either of Radiohead's latest CDs! =)",
  "I wouldn't describe it as a high. It feels incredibly mellow. Similar to the feeling you get the morning after a good party (and I don't mean a hangover).",
  "Later, as the Kava was wearing off, I smoked a spliff to stay chilled and lay down for a while. Extremely relaxed. I meditated for a while. Later that evening, I went out with my flatmates to shoot some pool. I actually found myself still very relaxed several hours later. That said, various people have told me that I'm one of the most chilled out people they've ever met. I guess it comes naturally...",
  "I'd recommend Kava to anyone feeling a bit stressed out. After an exam, this stuff would be ideal. I think Kava can teach people how to relax. How to take more things in their stride and better appreciate things.",
  "I like to think I normally take time out to appreciate things (all part of being a stoner), but I know far too many people who rush about all the time. If you find yourself so hyped up that you no longer take time out to enjoy a clear blue sky or properly listen to a good song -- go and have some Kava. Now! =)"
