  "<p>A short while ago I cam across a bag of A.C. seeds. They had been sitting around my room for a while. I was going to give them away but after reading about some mind blowing experiences from TIHKAL I decided to give it a whirl. He reports that the effects are like smoking n,n,dmt and 5-meo-dmt at the same time and this is what I was ready for.",
  "Preparation was as follows. 4 seeds where roasted in a pan with a lid. Roasted about 30 min on a fairly low flame. They are supposed to 'POP' like popcorn. My seeds are old and so void of water. It is supposed to be green inside mine was brown. One kind  popped the others just swelled up and the husk cracked. I then crushed the whole seeds with a mortar. When they where a fine powder I added about 1/8 tsp of baking soda. The base is important for full effects. So i added the baking soda roughly 2 parts seed 1 part base. It's my understanding lime paste is much better but I didn't have any on hand. I then added a *tiny* amount of boiling water . Filtered water of course. Just enough so I could swirl the mixture around in the little dish (dish for serving sauce maybe holds a few ounces). I then placed this on top of the oven with the oven set to 400. Took maybe 6 hours to totally dry. I then scraped it up with a razor and powdered again. I was left with a nice well-rounded mound about the size of a nickel. Probably about 1/2 tsp or so.",
  "Set and setting - I had smoked some cannibis earlier in the day. I ate some lunch and was fairly sober. I had been feeling like having a deep journey and was prepared for the mental effects. I had tried the tiniest little pinch of the powder. It hurt even in that small amount. Faced with maybe 500 times that amount to insufilate I knew it was goin to be very painful. I went into my bedroom no one was home. Had a well trusted friend babysitting. Comfortable environment for me. I got a puke bucket, placed it next to the bed. I made 2 large lines and got a straw ready. Took some deep breaths to relax. My heart was racing, palms sweaty, and hands trembling. I haven't been this scared before a voyage in years. I knew how much pain was coming.",
  "I began to insufflate as powerfully, fast, and deep as possible.",
  "T+ :02 seconds-I'm halfway through the first line. Tears are streaming down my face. I swallow and continue.",
  "t+:05 seconds I finish the whole first line, switch nostrils and try for the second. Don't get more then a pinch of the second line. Hurts so bad I stop and lay down quickly. So I got maybe just over 2 seeds into me.",
  "t+1 min- Pain is incredible. Tears are flowing down my face. Snot is pouring out of my nose and down my throat. I'm salivating like crazy. I'm spitting out saliva every few seconds.",
  "t+3 min - The endorphins are taking the edge off the pain. I can feel a mild 5meodmt effect starting. Aside from the pain in my nose the effect is pleasant. Also starting to get a bit sick in the stomach but not a big deal. Common for me with 5meodmt.",
  "t+5 min- I gag on the snot and vomit into the bucket. I am hanging over the bed with snot, tears, saliva, and vomit dripping down my face and beard. I notice just a slight psychedelic look to the sheets on my bed but just barely noticeable. No flowing patterns or anything like that. I think of how I must look and think that I'm glad my girlfriend isn't there to see. Then this seems funny and I'm slung over the bed giggling. Still intense pain.",
  "t+10 min- The peak of the experience is reached. Just a very mild 5meodmt-like body high.",
  "t+20 min- I blow the plant matter out of my nose. Effects still on a plateau. If it didn't hurt so much I would be enjoying it.",
  "Conclusion and a few brief thoughts - The pain is not worth what I felt. It took 18 hours to get the last of the plant material out of my nasal passages. Took 24 hours for the pain to stop. If I would have been blown away it would have been worth it. I see the point of snuff tubes. Too hard to insufflate that much stuff on your own. Blow it in and get it over with. If I would have got it all in I think it would have been pretty powerful. 2 seeds is not enough. Next time I will remove the husk of the seed it seems almost void of alkaloids considering the inside was super bitter when I chewed one, the outside not bitter at all. This will reduce the amount of material in half or so. Even better I think try muratic acid extraction discard plant material add lime paste mix well with a tiny bit of water. Let dry VERY well, powder and insufflate. Can't emphasis the pain enough. Makes insufflating meth, coke, sceletium t or 5meodmt seem like a party.</p>"
