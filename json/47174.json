  "<p>I have had many pleasant times with subutex and it is one of my favorite opioids. I have only tried subutex IV because i like the fast onset of opiates and that I get the 100% bio activaty of the drug.",
  "What it does for me: After injection the high starts at about 2-5 minutes after injection [1-2mg IV] and all my daily problems and anxiety is gone. Not as euphoric as morphine or oxycodone but it has abuse potential and gives me a good dose of euphoria and the effects lasts for a long time +6h, after that i usally inject again. The negative about the drug is that the tolerance raises fast and after three days of use i have to take atleast 4mg to feel the same effects.",
  "But this is anyway one of my favorite opioids and i take it wenever i come across it. I live in Sweden and the usual street price is about 25-35 USD for a 8mg subutex tab. But arent you a addict on opiats it is well worth it.",
  "Peace</p>"
