  "The set-up: Keep in mind that I am a fairly large person, and I have done Adderall quite a few times. This is the largest dose I have ever taken. I decided to go to a friends house to trip on 120mg of Adderall. He was to load up on caffeine to stay awake, and observe my trip. I took them around 5:00pm.",
  "6:00",
  "The first effects are just beginning to kick in. I feel the happiness that comes along with it. My mouth feels a little dry, but I dont notice it much.",
  "7:00",
  "The happiness increased, but still isnt anywhere near in full force. My typing speed and accuracy have both increased. My sense of time is just beginning to become slightly inaccurate.",
  "8:00",
  "I am feeling slightly tingly. Laughter doesnt come natural anymore, and I am able to suppress it now. I can feel vibrations and movements ripple through my body. I feel slightly light-headed, and I feel as if my skin is shrinking, and I am aware of my skin against my skull.",
  "8:15",
  "Im feeling wonderful. I feel like everyone loves me. Im so happy that I want to cry. I cant help but feel kindness and compassion towards everyone, even people I dont like. I have a slight pain in my back, but I think its because of the fact that Ive been moving around a lot. The pain is going away quickly. Even when it was there, it wasnt bad. It was hardly noticeable in fact. I feel more in tune with my body. My hands are slightly cold. They feel like machines. My typing accuracy is way up. I havent used the backspace key at all while typing this. I am developing a slight pressure in my head and left ear. Im not sure, but I think this may be the beginning of a small sinus headache. I dont think its drug related though. Off and on, a region of my head, at the top, in the middle, and slightly to the left, I feel a tingling alternating with a slight pain. My arms feel like one or two small needles are poking them. Oddly, the feeling is not unpleasant.",
  "8:30",
  "The general high is starting to subside. I can still feel it though. My face is tingling slightly. My right ear is starting to throb a little too. It feels about equivalent to an ear infection, only without the discharge and not NEAR as painful. In fact, pain really isnt so bad, and its easy to ignore. I still feel the occasional pressure near the sinus area. My stomach is slightly upset, but I barely notice it. I am still typing like mad, and accurately. The rippling is getting slightly more intense.",
  "9:00",
  "The intensity has subsided slightly, but the tingling is spreading. It keeps wavering as to its intensity. My hands are still cold, and while Im still typing faster and more accurately, Im not typing quite as fast.",
  "10:00",
  "My hearing is a bit muffled, and there is a slight echo effect, as I have had in the past. Its not at all unpleasant. Im also feeling a little hot. Im still feeling active, but I dont feel the urge to move my legs. Typing seems to calm me, because it releases my built up energy. My arms are starting to feel a little tired from all the typing. My cottonmouth is getting bad, but its not all that unpleasant. The tingling is coming back, this time in full force. The cycle continues: tingle, pressure, and then nothing.",
  "10:30",
  "My sight is starting to fade, and gets slightly blurry when I look at lights for a few seconds. Normally, it would only affect a part of my vision. Now, when I look at bright lights, it affects the whole of my vision. Its very odd. I dont notice it phase in and out, but somehow I know it does. Im getting the light-headedness again. Someone is playing music that, under normal circumstances, I would hate with a bloody passion. I dont mind it so much. Id like it, if I didnt know any better. Its five minutes later, and my vision is much better, but its still tinted orange-ish yellow. Im not sure if its the lighting, or just me. Im starting to lose my ability to discern normalcy from the extraordinary. It seems so natural. Normally, when Im active during the nighttime, I get a little warm. I feel that way now, only it seems natural, and almost preferable. Im beginning to feel a general good-naturedness towards everything. People who, under normal circumstances, I would fear, are now warm and friendly.",
  "11:00",
  "Im regaining my sense of humor slightly. I laughed (unforcefully) for the first time in quite a while. I havent laughed much all day, actually. Im feeling a little less hot than I was a half an hour ago. Im still feeling pretty restless, and now my typing has slowed. Due to my restlessness, I tend to have more errors. Every once in awhile, I still feel a wave of wonderful emotion flow over me. I still experience the same good-naturedness that Ive been experiencing for some time. This music is getting better and better, even though I know in my mind that its horrible. I feel as if I need to get up and jump up and down or something. My movements are starting to feel more fluid than usual. I feel groovy. Sometimes, I feel the urge to move my head from side to side, slowly, and Im moving it along with the rhythm of my typing. Ive been experiencing a few other unexplainable synchronicities as well. If I dont get up, I think Ill burst into flame!",
  "11:30",
  "When I put any significant weight on my legs, they almost act as if they are falling asleep. My typing speed is up a little, but my accuracy isnt up by much. Im having trouble typing this, because my leg is bouncing uncontrollably. This is the fist time that Ive been uncomfortable with any of the side-effects. I think that if I concentrate hard enough, I can make it stop. I may have to stop talking for a while. Apparently, it worked. I can control the shaking, but I have to concentrate very hard. Once it starts, its hard to stop. Im very sure that I can stop it from coming on in the first place. Im going to go crazy if I dont move soon. Its hard to type when Im so restless. My brain is going a mile a minute. My eyesight, which had gotten better, is now looking the way it did.",
  "Ive figured out that the orange and yellow tint is actually the natural colors of the light. It appears that I just seem to notice it more. My vision is still about the same as looking into a large area-encompassing light. For some reason, it seems to clear up when I look at things that appear to be at a distance, and oddly enough the same thing happens when I look at something thats moving. Moving things seem to pop out of the scenery ever so slightly. I seem to be doing all sorts of strange things with my hands when Im thinking about what to type. Ive developed some odd habits, such as running my fingers down the keyboard, and lightly tapping the keyboard with no intention of actually typing something. Its getting increasingly harder to refrain from bouncing my leg. I have to stop now, and stand up for awhile before this gets too out of hand.",
  "1:30",
  "A very annoying person has been pestering me for the past 2 hours. Thanks to this substance, Ive been able to tolerate it. I havent been able to type anything. Thankfully, nothing much has happened in the last two hours. Its been pretty much just more of the same.",
  "2:30",
  "The effects are really starting to take hold. I have slowed down significantly, and Im no longer shaking. In spite of this, I seem to be extremely cautious. Every time I see my shadow out of the corner of my eye, I jump, thinking that its a person. I looked at a window, and I saw a man peering in at me. I soon discovered that the voyeur was, in fact, my own reflection. Im not feeling nearly as much of the goodwill towards mankind kind of feelings, but Im not going to say that its entirely gone. Now I have shifted to paranoia. Im being extremely cautious in everything I do. Im even aware of the sound of my keyboard as I type. It seems loud, as if it could be heard throughout the whole house.",
  "The tingling has stopped for now. I have that headache that I felt coming on hours ago. Its not very bad, but its different from my normal sinus headaches. My eyes are just beginning to get sore from staring at the computer screen off and on for these past hours. My sense of time is more distorted than its ever been. Fifteen minutes have passed in what seemed like only one. At the same time, it feels like time is going by very slowly. I have no real comprehension of time. All that I know is numbers. I know that its 2:30 in the morning, but I dont feel that its 2:30 in the morning. My breathing seems to be rather choppy. Im not sure if it is, or if its an illusion. I have absolutely now way of telling now.",
  "3:30",
  "Im having many minor auditory hallucinations. I keep thinking that I see something out of the corner of my eye. I have to think really hard to remind myself that its just the drugs. Im going up and down constantly. Im beginning to become a little disassociated. Im having some major troubles thinking. My mind is thinking so fast, but never about what I want it to. Im having troubles finishing sentences. I have to use every ounce of strength that I possess to finish this. The paranoia is beginning to fade slightly. I feel a strong urge to move my head in a fluid, circular manner. I just made a remark about a triangle, so I am told. Im not sure its true. Im feeling the urge to move random body parts, but always in a circular manner. Im not even sure if its circular, but I can sense that there is some pattern to it. I have become happier than ever before. This is definitely the peak.",
  "4:00-4:30",
  "I was completely wrong about the peak. If this isnt it, I cant wait to see what happens next. I have lost all since of time. Im so happy that I want to cry. Ive just had a few visual hallucinations, along with the auditory. So far, Ive heard a dog howling in the night, Ive seen a pig walk through the door after snorting loudly from upstairs, and Ive heard sheep in the distance. I looked at myself in the mirror, and I saw my fathers face staring back at me. My muscular coordination is waxing and waning. I can direct my general movements, but it seems that I cant refine my movements. The fluidity is gone. I stop, and stare into space while my entire body tingles.",
  "I can no longer fully control it. I have given over to the power of suggestion. There is a slight burning in my throat. For some reason, I like it. I associate the basic outline of various objects and figures with numbers and letters. I am constantly trying to decipher these messages. They are trying to tell me something, but I just cant put my finger on it. The doorway just spelled hello. I cant help but think about everything. Memories are rushing back in waves. I recall the days events. How long has it been since I started this entry. I cannot tell. It could have been a year.",
  "5:00",
  "By now, all of the effects have subsided. I am completely exhausted, and I got to bed."
