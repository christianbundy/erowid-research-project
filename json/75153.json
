 "report": "<p>I have been tripping LSD since I was about 17 years old. I am an experienced rave kid from my time so I used to trip every weekend for about 3 years straight. The scene died off here so I did not take acid near as much but I did here and there for the past few years.</p><p>I am now 25 and took acid for the first time in 6 months since I started taking Lithium. The guy said the acid was strong but I shrugged it off like nothing since his stuff is either hit or miss. Within 10 mins of dosing I was tripping so hard I could not drive. Had I not been close to my destination I would have had to pull over. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I get into the party and everything is fine. There is a dj that I cant stand and it starts. From that point my husband tells me I started to look like I was mentally handicapped. I began yelling in tongues to the party, my eyes were wide as they could have been, and a I started preaching in tongues  to the people. I was not speaking English so this is what he says I was doing.  I thought I was giving a sermon to everyone about how there is a balance to the universe and how everyone is ignoring it. This was all in my head.</p><p>At this point I began to have a seizure. My husband says my eyes rolled back and I began to shake violently. My arms went crazy all around my face. There was no color to my eyes, it was all black.  I passed out for about 45 mins. When I woke up he escorted me to the car. I woke up the next morning with painful body aches and my jaw hurt severely.</p><p>I do not remember hardly anything from the party. I remember a couple of djs or people I saw but nothing about the actual experience. Mixing LSD with Lithium has been one of the most horrific experiences of my life. I NEVER had a problem with acid until I took this drug while being prescribed this antidepressant. Please if you are taking Lithium, be aware that if you are taking Lithium, your world could be fucking turned upside down. Hallucinations were intensified by 100%, I had a seizure, and I experienced one of the more embarrassing moments of my life. Sure the visions I had were badass, but that does not compensate for foaming at the mouth and yelling at a party while a dj is playing, then having a seizure and passing out. This was such an intense trip I could not understand vocabulary, could not comprehend my name or even what a name was. Yes, it went that far. Please if you are taking Lithium, heed all cautions when it comes to LSD and Lithium. Stop taking the lithium at least a week before you dose. If you dont, please have a seroquel, xanax, klonopin, valium, etc. nearby if you do. When I was tripping too hard like I did, I wished I had one of these available.</p>",
