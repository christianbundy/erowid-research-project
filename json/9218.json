 "report": "<p>Saturday night, labor day weekend, the local electronic music record label threw a house party, to which I was invited. They usually play some incredible psytrance so I decided that this would be the perfect setting to trip. Psytrance has the capacity to potentiate psychedelics and to induce altered states just on its own. I am pretty comfortable with the guys in the label so I had no qualms about tripping around them. I have always wanted to try the famous hippy-flip so I decided that this would be the main course for the night.</p><p>Before the party, I weighed out 5 grams of shrooms because 5 grams to me is a plus 2 on the Shulgin scale (I have a frustratingly high tolerance to shrooms). I wasn't looking to go out of my gourd that night. The E was an old tab that I had tested. I also went to various sex stores buying nitrous and Rush (Isobutyl Nitrite). I slept most of Saturday and did not eat anything when I got up. Right before the party, around 8:30 PM, I ate the shrooms and then chased them with a little white rice. Shrooms come on very fast for me so I was starting to feel them as I got to the party around 9. The party was disorienting at first. There was a strange mix of people from drunken poor white folks, to regular joes, to ravers. I soon got used to all the craziness though, especially after my friend brewed me some Chi and Yerba tea. About an hour and a half into the shroom trip I took the ecstasy. An hour later this nice substance kicked in subtly.  I could feel the added energy and noticed I was a bit more talkative but it was subtle because Shrooms also give me some ecstasy-like effects. Both are cruising drugs for me. Shrooms start out making me very tired and then by the 3rd hour, give me so much energy its hard to sleep for hours afterward. Even so this energy is not speedy energy. It makes me very awake but I don't bounce around the room. Shrooms also put me in a very good mood and even give me some nice tactile effects similar to E. Ecstasy gives me enough energy in my body to produce some jaw clenching but at the same time it makes me feel relaxed to the point where I just want to sit around. Ecstasy has never made me want to get up and dance my ass off like it does with most of my friends. So the effects from the 2 drugs combined well to the point where it was hard to tell when the E kicked in. I was merely on a slightly new level of 'cruise mode'.</p><p>Approximately 2 hours after I dosed the E, I broke out some 2C-T-2 for another friend. He wanted to do some shrooms or roll with me but I didn't have enough to go around so I brought over some T-2 of which I had an excess. I had previously measured out 50 mg on a Deering 10g scale. We eyed this out into 3 separate piles of approximately 16 mg of T-2. I had done a similar dose once before and considering the fact that Shrooms and E weren't overly intense, I decided to dose with my friend. We threw the powder up in some cans of Coke and drank it down. About an hour after this he came onto his when he was DJ-ing and said he felt really fucked up. The drug really locked him into spinning psytrance though and he spun very well during the peak. Half an hour after this I felt the T-2.  However this drug also evenly melded with my present mind state. The perception change was as subtle as coming onto the E. There was just a slight shift upward in energy, patterns, tactile feelings. The strange thing about this T-2 experience is that I didn't get stomach cramps until about an hour and a half after I first started to feel the drug. My first experience gave me stomach cramps before I saw patterns, etc. Another strange thing is that Shrooms usually give me cramps too and I had very little cramps from these earlier in the evening. My friend brewed up some more Chi tea which was excellent for settling the stomach and is now an essential part of any future T-2 trip. Around 3AM, I also felt a tightening in my neck and jaws, similar to a caffeine headache. The T-2 had increased my jaw clenching and I attribute the headache to this. My lower back was pretty sore too, which is common when I take E, T-7, Acid, or any other drug that makes me clench my muscles. I decided not to get into the Nitrous or Rush because I knew it would only increase my headache. We all finally went to bed around 7 but I couldn't sleep until 8:30.</p><p>This trip was never very intense. The visual hallucinations were mild but beautiful patterns covering everything. Walls breathed and colors were heightened but I did not see entities and people's faces did not distort. The music was awesome! However, I think that even though the drugs added to the music, my enjoyment of the sound had to do more with the quality of the music than the drugs.  My mind stayed pretty much intact and I found it easy to carry on conversations with people I did not know. I did get philosophical, which is a typical part of any shroom trip but my mind was not so expanded that it was blown apart.</p><p>The hippy flip and then adding the T-2 was definitely different than what I expected. It was not like the Candy flip which is an amazing synergy of 2 drugs, producing an experience that is greater than the effect of the 2 alone. For me, E, shrooms, and T-2 just maintained a certain chilled plus 2 mind space all night long.</p><p>---HeWhoLives</p>",
