 "report": [
  "Now this was a very interesting experience with both substances, never done LSA or nutmeg before.  The nutmeg was consumed at about 10:30 one evening a couple of weeks back, waited around for about an hour for anything... Nothing in the slightest happened.  11:00 had come around and I was anxious to try the morning glory seeds (heavenly blue and pearly gates) so I went to my bathroom spoke to the plants that I have growing asking for there permission and then ingested about 250 to 300 seeds. ",
  "That night I stayed awake until about 12:30 or 1:00a.m. being extremely tired I crashed in my room, beside my ever present dog with incense and the tube going (Evil Dead 2).  The reason that I crashed so early is because in the past on my Dextromethorphan excursions I could go to sleep and awaken in about an hour as it started to kick in.  My dog like I said is with me whenever I do any psychotropic, because she knows she can sense my altered state, and helps keep me from drifting to the dark side.",
  "Unfortunately the time never came for me to wake up until the next morning... Man was I in for a surprise.  I awoke around 5:00a.m., (the thing is though that I knew what time it was before I even opened my eyes) but anyway I awoke to the thought of just being extremely tired for some reason, this however was not true.  I slowly came to the realization that the dizziness and odd sensation that I had was from the nutmeg/LSA.  The walls seemed to rumble not move but rumble, candles to block negative energy were quickly lit as well as incense. ",
  "The fear overtook me though my first/worst bad trip.  This was the only time that I ever was thrown into the hurling chaos of a 'bummer' I was able to hold it of for around 2 hours through guided meditation and speaking through my minds eye with my dog.  Quickly overtaken for the next few hours of existence by visions of death and failure, being sent off to jail losing all hope of everything. ",
  "Even though it was a horrible experience, I am planning on doing both again, but no entangling of the two one or the other.  I do consider myself lucky though, if it hadn't have been for that experience then I would still be doing synthetics."
