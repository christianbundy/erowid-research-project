 "report": "<p>Well, this was my first experience with xanax and I didn't know that it would make me drowsy. So I did the normal thing and I decided to sleep. I began to lucid dream for the first time in my life. So what happened was that I had a conversation with my mom about grades and then I found myself in some clouds. These were pink and fluffy clouds and the sky was yellow. I was really feeling them touch my skin and it was unexplainable. I never dreamt so real. Then I found myself dreaming that I was in a spanish ship rowing across the sky. It was night and I could see the stars. It was so vivid. Then I saw a nude blond girl with medium length hair. I began to touch her body and it honestly felt real. I then began having intercourse with her and I could feel it all. Very vivid. I could literally put my hands on her and thrust.</p><p>I would guess about 10 minutes later I wake up and my mind is very confused because I thought it was real. I even contemplated it for a few seconds. It was my best experience with dreaming and with xanax.</p>",
