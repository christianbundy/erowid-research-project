  "T=0:00 :- Started drinking alcohol: 7 - 12 standard drinks were consumed over the night.",
  "T=6:00 :- Ingested orally: 4mL of Clonazapam (2.5mg/mL)",
  "T=6:20 :- 5 standard drinks were consumed by this time",
  "T=6:20 :- 200mg of Tramadol was ingested intra-nasally, by this point the Clonazapam had started to take effect. It felt similar to being effected by approximately an extra 5 standard drinks of alcohol.",
  "T=6:20-6:40 :- The Clonazapam was now having a significant effect and seemed to really increase the effects of the alcohol. I usually get quite drunk from 15 standard drinks.  On this occasion I felt the same but felt no obvious nausea. This is abnormal for me. I also started feeling very drowsy.",
  "T=6:40 := 1/2 of a relatively high strength ecstasy tablet was ingested orally, a 'white turtle' that was around in the autumn of 2006 in Melbourne, Victoria for those playing at home. I laid back on the couch and from this point I remember nothing and when I say nothing I mean exactly that. To me, as soon as my head hit that couch, I woke up at approximately T = 14:00 in another room.",
  "The following recount is complied from the recollections, photos and video taken on the night by my close friends:",
  "T=6:40 := I was disorientated, incoherent, uncoordinated, obnoxious, rude and arrogant. My friends likened the latter three symptoms to the type of person I become on cocaine. I was stumbling around and obsessively adamant on going out for a walk to buy cigarettes. A friend of mine affectingly called my state 'fishbowling'*, where my memory was no longer than 3 seconds long. ",
  "*Definition of 'Fishbowling' (verb): Metaphorical term comparing an individual suffering extreme short term memory loss (",
  "I was keen to take some magic mushrooms that were available on this particular night.  Importantly to me, this is one drug that I adamantly refuse to consume and have NO intention of ever taking. Luckily I have very good friends and the offer was just in jest. This again proved how my steadfast inhibitions were EASILY lifted. Later I was stunned to learn of this fact, and how far from myself I had actually traveled.",
  "T=7:20 := Orally ingested the second 1/2 of the ecstasy tablet. I now entered a state of intermittent consciousness. I would converse normally for a 2-3 minutes, which was immediately followed by a 10-15 second catatonic episode.  Following this, I would resume the preceding conversation I had so elegantly left.",
  "I should also mention that I do not remember any of the last 40 minutes so I cannot tell you if I felt any of the ecstasy and Tramadol which is the CRUX of this report: to highlight the strength of Clonazapam and its overpowering effects over the other drugs consumed. I should also mention. I continued in this state for another 60-80 minutes after which I fell into a deep sleep from which I could not be woken. My friends carried me on the couch that I passed out on into another room so I could just sleep it off at which point I vomited (no memory of this occurrence). By far my most proudest hour.",
  "T=14:00 := I awoke and had absolutely no recollection of what happened between T=6:40-8:40. This was a completely surreal feeling, especially considering the fact that after seeing the videos/photos from that time period, my memories were not revived, even to this day two months later. To me those 2 hours didn't happen. The person I saw in the photos and videos was not me, it was my body, but it wasn't my conscious mind controlling it. This may be a difficult concept for someone to understand who hasn't experienced it. When I did wake I was still mildly confused and disorientated, but I had regained conscious control of my mind (thank god!!). When I finally got home a couple hours later I slept for 17 hours. ",
  "The point of this report is to highlight the frightening power of the drug Clonazapam. Bart's final thought after listening to taped sessions: 'Does my voice really sound like that?'",
