 "report": [
  "I will begin this report with saying that I have had much experience with opiate-based pain killers and have a high tolerance to there effects. Thus, I would not recommend the dose I took for the first time use of this drug, it is really powerful. It should also be noted that the oral preparation of Butorphanol, used in this experience, is only available through veterinary prescription only. Other wise, the drug is taken IM, IV, or through the use of a nasal spray.",
  "It all began at around 12:30AM, I was watching the movie Fight Club down stairs in my house with one of my best friends when I decided to get up and take a quick look around the house for some cough medicine for my aching throat. Low and behold, the first cabinet I opened had multiple prescriptions left from my recently deceased Great Dane. After quickly looking at about half the bottles, I decide that there was nothing worth my time, when, literally out of impulse, I checked another bottle.",
  "The label read 'Give 1 tablet twice daily if needed for pain.'. The bottle also bore the name Torbutrol, which I quickly plugged into yahoo, finding its true name to be Butorphanol. I went online and found some basic and useful information, mainly focusing my attention on what related to the oral preparation, such as its relation to the opiate based pain killer Morphine.",
  "Boom that was enough for me. After checking briefly with my very cool straight edge friend and seeing that he would not feel uncomfortable, I quickly popped and crushed one of the 5 mg pills in my mouth, swallowing with Arizona Ice Tea. It tasted like a chemical should, shitty, but not enough so as to stop me from crushing what turned out to be two more in my mouth. At this point in time it was 12:50AM. Within the next two hours, I had taken two more 5mg pills.",
  "The 45 minutes after popping the first pill was steady come up, which strangely did not feel similar to any opiate-based pain killer I had done before, other than maybe Oxycontin. I then popped the second pill, crushing it in my mouth and this time waiting a solid hour to assess my situation. There were intense feelings of relaxation, and at this point, when accompanied with standing, intense feelings of lightness and a mild sensation of floating. I only got up from the couch a handful of times to smoke pot or go to the bathroom. Although I have not done Morphine, which is more similar to Butorphanol than Codeine, my experience with Codeine and floating was similar in this respect to the Butorphanol. ",
  "At this point in time it was 2:35 AM and I was stoned as fuck from the full force of the two pills and the pot that I had smoked when taking the previous dose (pill #2 @ 1:35AM). It was in this altered state of mind that I took the third pill, it was one of the stupidest things I have ever done. When you can't let your self crash until 5AM because youre afraid of not waking up in the morning, you know something is wrong with your decision.",
  "About 15 minutes after taking the third pill, I began to panic. Had I taken WAY too much? I then remembered online that I had seen that the Human dosage of the drug, which can only be taken by injection or by nasal spray was a mere 1 to 2 mg. I had taken 15 mg total which made me very nervous. After about another hour, I headed upstairs to go to bed, with my friend sleeping on the floor of my bedroom.",
  "I had lost the ability to trust myself at this point, feeling like I had betrayed myself. So, down about my recent drug usage and the fact that this shit could actually be way more potent than I had originally thought, my night turned VERY weird in an overall negative way. Hitting the hay at around 3:30AM, I had already made the mental decision that I would give myself till ten of 5AM so as to try and be on the come down when I passed out. So I talked for a few minutes with my buddy, threw off the lights, and put on a pair of head phones.",
  "After about 5 minutes, I decided to put the music through the speakers that I had in my room because my friend wanted to sleep to it. I remember putting a rap mix on of 9 songs and then blacking out shortly after a song or two. I do not think I feel asleep because when I could remember shit again/when I came too, I found myself quite frustrated with hearing the music for what was probably the 3rd or 4th time, which at the time felt impossible to have truly occurred. I was confused, still nervous over how much I had taken and how ridiculously fucked I felt, I hap hazardously let myself be taken by what would be 5-6 hours of horribly restless, endless tripping.",
  "I have tripped many times on shrooms, even more on DXM, and have done special K, so I guess I know how tripping feels. The only other time this has happened to me with pain killers was with a massive dose of Viks, again right before bedtime. I lived a lifetime in this dream/half-awake half-asleep bullshit. Not to mention the vivid closed eye hallucinations that I was having when I first settled down with my headphones on, the hallucinations included intense feelings/visuals of my 'addiction at work'. Something I knew was normally impossible, it made me smile for the first time since being in bed. I seemed to be able to have and control these intense waves of relaxation which would over come my body in the what would end up being some of the most conscious moments in the other-wise restless trip night.",
  "I should also mention I lost all sense of time, with an hour at one point feeling like a minute, and the next hour feeling like a lifetime. Bizarre and annoying when trying to get some sleep. In the end I left the experience drained and down."
