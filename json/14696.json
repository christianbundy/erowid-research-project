 "report": "<p>I have experimented with many pharmeceuticals lately, some of which have had very little effect and some have been a lot of fun.  One night I came across some lorazepam (generic ativan).  I decided to try it out and downed three of the tiny 1 mg pills.  About an hour later I started feeling very relaxed, and kind of dreamy.  About an hour and a half after taking them, i felt like I was in a sort of dream world and lost alot of my inhibitions, kind of like I would if I were drunk.  For the next half hour I was somewhat drowsy and relaxed but still had the energy to enjoy the dreamy high.  After about 2 hours I felt a wave of drowsiness and decided to go to sleep it felt really good laying in bed and I had a very good sleep, the only problem was that i had some trouble getting up in the morning.</p><p>Overall i'd say this was a good experience.  I can see many uses for this drug, at lower doses of 1 or 2 mg's you can probably still get some of the effects without the overwhelming drowsiness.  At those doses it would be fun to use at a party or just to have some fun.  This drug is also very effective if you want something to relax you before bed.</p>",
