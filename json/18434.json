 "report": [
  "2g of 4-methylmethcathinone arrived from a reputable online vendor. It takes ten days, and arrives packaged in a small clear ziploc bag. The contents are a fine, dry crystalline powder that has a distinctive sweet smell.",
  "Prior to swallowing our initial 100mg dose of 4-methylmethcathinone the four of us, all of whom are between the ages of 32 and 40, sat down to a light vegetarian meal (spaghetti Bolognese) accompanied by a beer or glass of red wine each. All of us have substantial experience in taking stimulants of all kinds, but have over time narrowed our interest in these to cocaine and MDMA as these, in our opinion, work best for our headspace and in terms of body load and duration. However we feel that over the years these have shown their downsides, thus our interest in mephedrone, which reportedly mimics the effects of both. We are all in a good place, and have planned ahead for this test drive by setting tomorrow aside. We have food, drink, liquor and smoke and are as ready as well ever be to step into the unknown.",
  "We took the first dose ten minutes after eating.",
  "T+ 0:00 We swallow the 100mg the bombs. Were listening to jazzy music, laid back.",
  "T+ 0:10 A very slight elevation, but only noticeable when standing up suddenly. We chat, listening to music. We agree that we feel slight warmth.",
  "T+ 0:20 We each insufflate 50mg. Its painful, although not as painful as other substances, and makes our eyes water. Slightly sweet odour, similar to MDMA. The backdrop burns a bit on the tongue and throat and spreads gradually over the tongue.",
  "T+ 0:22 Boom! After snorting the line, we all feel it. Clear, speedy, like shifting up a gear, it comes on strong. Writing is easy, and concentration is on point. Its a bit rushy too. Similar, as other psychonauts reports have related, to speed, coke or MDMA. Elevation is tangible, yet the mindstate clear as a bell. Slight aural distortion, as though there is a new sonic texture or depth. The talking continues, easy chit-chat and banter. The mood is upbeat and we all give the experience the thumbs-up thus far. We are impressed.",
  "T+ 0:35 Decide to change the music to electronic music to rest the reported enhancement. Leftfields Leftism seems appropriate. Turns out to be the right choice. Were feeling slight jaw tension, and were experiencing visual twitching a la MDMA. Definitely rushy, mephedrone doesnt seem to lend itself to the overwhelming body rush of MDMA but rather a more steady, cruisy, floating sensation.",
  "T+ 1:00 We snort a 100mg line each and holy crap, we are officially caned. The conversations are flowing freely, and the Leftfield is quite simply perfect. We all agree that its the greatest electronic album ever made, and that it in particular is responsible for turning the world on to dance music. Music appreciation? Check.",
  "When not focusing, visual field is blurred, but when focusing, the object of my attention is quite clear. Writing on paper is not a problem, but reading the monitor is outta the question, and queuing music on the computer is only possible with one eye closed! We all report funky eye action (nystagmus). Were all having ourselves a grand time, chatting, listening to music, and having a ball.",
  "T+ 1:20 At this stage we decide to just get on with the business of enjoying ourselves. The rest of the report will be written when we emerge from the other side of the experience. ",
  "Post-Test Drive",
  "After the last report, we continued to snort and eat the mephedrone until was finished  yes, it causes compulsive redosing. That said, the hangover, in comparison to ecstacy and cocaine, is not as bad. All in all our experience lasted from around 7pm till 4am.",
  "Overall, the experience was one not dissimilar from coke and ecstasy. Mephedrone has all the effects of ecstasy, but is somehow lighter, both in body and mind, and is of shorter duration. Included in the physical effects are the bruxism and eye-twitching, rolling and squinting  quite pronounced too, compared to ecstasy, which only produces these as a result of a heavy dose. Like coke, the elevation, sense of well being and talkativeness is distinct, yet mephedrone is not as intense and we were able to hold long and coherent discussions which lasted for some time, and did not feature the marked disjointedness and 'me! me! me!' focus of cocaine.",
  "The peak lasts for no more than two hours, with the comedown gentle and fairly swift, with waves of clarity giving way to clear-headedness, and eventually, base level. Repeat dosing led to the physical effect increasing, but the mental state reaching a plateau. An interesting (and not entirely unwelcome) effect observed by all test pilots was a lack of interest in alcohol and cigarettes which lasted from the first, quick, escalation to intoxication till the second redose, after which it tapered off. This could be put down to the overwhelming onset experienced, as has been observed in previous sessions where a substance entirely new to the body. All in all we give it a tentative thumbs-up as far as the experience goes, but would caution anyone planning on taking this new and largely unresearched substance to be vigilant about redosing: if you can, store extra mephedrone in a place where you cannot access it while under the influence. When snorted, its as bad as cocaine when it comes to fiending."
