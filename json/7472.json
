 "report": "<p>I made a crude extraction of Syrian Rue by boiling approximately 20 grams of the coarsely ground seeds in water and lemon juice.  I kept the brew on a low boil for about 2 hours, drained off the orange liquid into a cup, and repeated the process with fresh water and lemon juice.</p><p>The next morning at 7:00 a.m. I slowly consumed a beverage made from sugar and about half the syrian rue extract.  I thought the extract of 10 grams of seeds should be about the proper dose for MAO inhibition to synergize with the two doses of LSD I consumed 10 minutes later.  I had packed a backpack full of enough gear to stay outside all day, so I foolishly got in the car to drive to a local park about 15 minutes away.</p><p>I arrived at my destination before the drugs started their effect, but as soon as I got out of the car and started to walk around, I realized I was extremely dizzy, light-headed, and sensitive to sunlight.  I continued to walk into the woods, but my symptoms progressed to increased sweating and nausea. I proceeded to vomit the Syrian Rue extract and LSD onto the ground.  I felt slightly better, so I decided to head back to the car.  I slowly dragged my tired body to the car, stopping to catch my breath every few minutes.  Just before arriving at my car, I had another vomiting session.</p><p>I foolishy decided to drive back to my apartment before I became even sicker.  On the drive back, I had to take a few minute off-road break for another session of vomiting.  When I arrived, I managed to become comfortable on my bed.  I then slept, vomited, and smoked marajuana to reduce nausea for the next 8 hours.</p><p>I think the MAOIs of the Syrian Rue caused a hypertensive crisis and then induced sleep for a recovery period.  I had avoided all foods and drugs unsafe with MAOIs.  I do not know if the LSD had any effect since I vomited it up so early.  I do know that it was foolish of me to consume an indeterminate dose of MAOIs.  Be careful of overdosing on extractions of Syrian Rue.</p>",
