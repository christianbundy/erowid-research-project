 "report": "<p>A couple of cousins and I went to a rather small music festival for 4 days in September of 2009. I will call them G and T. I had never been to any festivals but G had been to a couple so he told me what to expect. He told me that people would be walking around selling every kind of mind expanding substance I could want.</p><p>We set up our camp in a somewhat secluded area. The first day was just the preparty so there was somewhere in the range of 500 to 1000 people there. The first day we had just gotten some MDMA and it was a good time. The next morning we had just hung out at our camp site. This guy came back into our campsite and asked if we needed any acid. I really wanted to get some because I had only done it once before and it really wasn't all that intense. I purchased a ten strip and he told me not to take any more than 2 doses because some guy the previous night had taken 3 and completely stripped out of every article of clothing he had on and ran naked through a gigantic corn field. I didn't want that to happen to me (obviously) so I dropped two doses around one o'clock. G and T each dropped 1 dose.</p><p>About an hour or so later it hit me and T. We both burst into uncontrollable laughter. We could not talk at all and just kept laughing at everything and that went on for about 45 minutes. G was not tripping nearly as hard as either of us and was starting to get frustrated because neither of us could say anything back to him and he was the only one talking. Also, keep in mind that I had not left the camp that day. G said we should go walk around because he was getting board of sitting there watching us laugh. We said okay and before we left I dropped another dose because I still had no visuals. I am now up to 3 doses and we left our camp.</p><p>Right as I stepped out from behind the thicket of trees our camp was behind everything changed. For the worst. I had not left our camp since there was about 500 to 1000 people. There was now about 3000 to 4000 people there. I did not believe it so I walked out to where everyone parked their cars and all I saw were cars. As far as I could see was just cars. At this point I began to have the most intense visuals of my whole life. It seemed as though everyone was staring right at me. This began to scare me and I just kept telling myself that everything was okay and that it was just drugs. That didn't work in the slightest bit and things just kept getting worse. Now every person that I walked by was not only staring right at me, but everyone looked like the ugliest, scariest person I had ever seen. I put my head down and continued to walk.</p><p>I had no idea where G and T were so I went back to the campsite and they weren't there. I laid down on a blanket and looked up at the sky through a completely pine needleless pine tree. All of a sudden all of the branches on the tree began to spin around. It was really cool looking and this made me forget what a bad trip I was having. The brown on the tree began to come off in ribbons as the branches kept turning. The ribbons of brown were flowing up to the sky until there was no tree left at all. This completely baffeled me. THERE WAS NO TREE AT ALL! After a minute or so, or at least what I thought was a minute, ribbons of blue began to come down from the sky. They did exactly what the brown ribbons did only in reverse. The ribbons were building the tree back up! Before I knew it I had a sky blue tree sitting in front of me. It was amazing.</p><p>I really had to go to the bathroom at this time so I decided it would be okay for me to go even though it was really scary out there before. It seemed like my trip took a complete 180 degree turn for the better but I could not have been more wrong. Everything was fine until I reached the porta-potties. There was about 30 people waiting to use the bathrooms so I stood in this big group of people who were also waiting. 30 seconds later I completely lost my hearing. I could not hear anything. I was still calm until everyone completely turned around and stared at me. I'm sure this didn't really happen but it seemed completely real to me. I could hear nothing and all these people were looking right at me. I just started walking away and at that point everything was completely overwhelming and I just curled up in a ball on the ground and started to cry. I had no idea where I was in relation to the campsite and it seemed like this trip could get no worse.</p><p>I was on the ground for maybe 5 to 10 seconds before a big group of people came up to me and began telling me that everything was okay and that I was going to be alright. When I heard that everything that was bad about my trip completely turned around. I found G and T back at the campsite (someone had to help me find it) and they were so glad to see me. The whole time I was at the camp they were looking for me and I was also really happy to see them. From then on it was nothing but good vibes and great visuals. In the end I really don't regret taking 3 doses. It was completely overwhelming and scary at times but now I know. When someone tells you not to take 3 doses, don't take 3 doses.</p>",
