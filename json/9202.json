  "I have only ever snorted 2CB because where Im from, the UK, the shit is pretty expensive. We pay ten pounds (18 bucks?) for a capsule of  I think  10 mg of the powder, which we whack into one line and snort.",
  "People say snorting 2CB is the only way to go, and although I never took it orally Id say theyre probably right. I thought Id provide a few pointers:",
  "1)\tThe burn. 2CB doesnt sting *that* much. It makes my nose run like crazy however, and there will be short periods of pain for the first twenty minutes or so. I ride it out.",
  "2)\tThe drip. The drip on 2CB is pretty gross compared to many other chemicals. Not only is the taste nauseating, it stings my throat a bit, and the sensation of having something crawling down my throat as I'm coming up HARD on a psychedelic is not pleasant. I have something to drink and some weed to get rid of the nausea.",
  "3)\tThe nausea. Ive seen people properly purge on 2CB before actually being able to feel good  partly because the drip is just so rank. Ive never felt more than a bit sick but snorted 2CB does hit my body quite suddenly, so I guess for some people their bodies will just say, right  something is up here, lets flush out the stomach and see if that helps.",
  "4)\tOnset. Onset is fairly fast and fairly furious for me  I feel the first alerts as soon as I lift my head from whatever substance I snort from and Ill be peaking within forty minutes. The come up is similar to a STRONG ecstasy come-up, and I think to myself, oh no. This is going to be too much, things will get too weird. Once that phase is finished and I begin to level off and loosen up things get GREAT.",
  "5)\tEffects. 2CB is almost my favourite drug. The come up is just a bit too strong for it to be perfect. For me snorted 2CB gives peak effects that start to finish about 3.5 hours after dosing so duration is perhaps a little too short. I can still get visuals if I want to up to 6 hours after snorting the stuff. Visuals are absolutely delicious, I remain quite lucid and only gently introspective while the entire visual field is distorted. More introspection comes as the drug wears off but I can think about things that would mess me up on LSD and still be in complete control on juicy bees.",
  "Physically, I feel energised yet not wired. Body tripping doesnt affect me that much  legs feel like a mild ecstasy high, occasional waves through the body. One time I felt like the group of people I was with, who were all sober (although fine with drugs), were kind of watching me a bit too much. I realise now they werent but I kinda felt self-conscious and this led to a kind of jitter in my lower neck. It happened a few times when I felt people were focussing on me. It faded however.",
  "6) Comedown/day after. 2CB is very easy on my body. Next day will be a little tired, but sleep and food after it is easy. No depression over lasting aching ever noticed. Taking 2CB with X seems to alleviate comedown effects of the X for me.",
  "2CB at 10mg snorted is definitely controllable but the strong come-up and the fact that the pretty visuals and mild dissociation/weird body effects contribute to a fact that nothing is real (I often feel that when I take 2CB, a little world is constructed purely for my own pleasure) means I have to be careful. If I'm in a situation where I could get hurt  or worse, make a social faux pas (only joking), I am on my guard.",
  "Dysphoria has never been present. Negative thoughts are controllable and Ive never been trapped in a loop on 2CB. It seems to be unique in the psychedelics Ive tried (LSD, shrooms, AMT, DMT) in that its a PSYCHEDELIC that makes me care *less* and makes me lighten up. Thats where its similar to MDMA for me.",
  "Peace!"
