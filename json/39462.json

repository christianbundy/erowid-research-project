 "report": "<p>I had absoloutely nothing to do all day because college was closed. Because it's quite a distance from where I live, it means that my friends are even further away, so I knew that I would have to entertain myself. Having tried mushrooms for the second time less than a week previously, though it was the first time I'd actually had enough to trip, I was extremely excited about them and desperately wanted to experiment more, and like an impatient child, as soon as possible. I went and bought an ounce of them and went for a joint in the local graveyard while I admired them. I then went home.</p><p>I'd told my boyfriend that I'd ring him at 11 so I didn't want to get shroomed up before then. I waited til afterwards when the rest of the house had gone to bed. I was full of excitement. I ate about half the box and sat back and waited. Half an hour passed and nothing happened. It really annoyed me so I ate the rest of the box apart from a couple of small stems because it's the stems that taste the worst in my opinion, and there was an awareness forming that what I'd already eaten would be quite adequate!</p><p>I paced around the room waiting and my mood started to change. I wasn't tripping at all, I just kept seeing familiar objects in my room that were filling me with dread, I was thinking to myself 'I do not wanna look at that when I'm trippin'. I hid a couple of things and put some music on, my favourite, cradle of filth, but it only made me feel more uneasy. I turned it off because I kept imagining that if I turned my back a devil would pop out of the cd player for some reason, well actually in my minds eye it was more like a teradactyl, but a very demonic one. I still wasn't completely tripping yet though, I hadn't actually seen anything, I just felt a terrible feeling of dread and worry so I decided to get into to bed and bury my head thinking what a fool I was and it was my fault that I was about to have a bad trip all by myself.</p><p>Then suddenly, 50 minutes after taking the first of them, pow! It felt amazing. My whole body felt so strange, in such a pleasureable way, and I sat bolt upright and spent some minutes fixated with my jaw, it felt like an unnecessary attachment. I then looked around the room, and felt so exhilaratingly high I started talking to myself, about how there were four walls but only one ceiling believe it or not. I found that incredibly funny and started to write down what I was saying. I was especially delighted to realise that I was in fact Jazz from Jazzworld and I laughed and laughed to myself. Strange runes were floating accross my vision in beautiful colours.</p><p>My eyes started to water then, they just seemed to gush until the whole front of me was drenched, and I put my hands up to wipe the tears, it felt really good. As I was rubbing my face, my hand ended up clasped on my cheek which suddenly started to come away from my face, oozingly so. I spent afew moments terrified that I was melting before I reminded myself that it was just the shrooms and that I should treat it as a game. I got up off the bed, still oozing, and threw myself to the floor in a big pile of schlop. I had melted at will. RIDICULOUS! was the word that kept repeating through my head and it felt great.</p><p>I lay on the floor, imagining myself as a pile of mess with a pair of beady eyes just lying in the middle of the room, in which every object was either moving or glowing. I was impressed with my shroomed world, it was very pretty. I then got up, but it wasn't like standing up, I was a shroom quickly growing upwards tall and proud, until I was upright when I became an animal: I commentated it as well 'I am a shroom, now I am an animal and I can dance' and I leapt around the room feeling like I was a totally different shape to one I'd ever been before, laughing and laughing.</p><p>I then sat down on the bed looking at the room. I commented on how the bloke in the film did very strange things with his time. It was a very mundane film, but I thought that he must be being very silly all the same, I laughed at the silly man. I admired the rest of my room, words scuttled off my posters and back again and everything was moving, changing or breathing in some way. I then glanced at the objects on my bedside table, a bottle of water was on it and I picked it up and started to play with it, wanting to play with it in some way. I decided that the fact that there would then be water on the floor, was not actually reason enough to stop me pouring it all over the floor anyway, so I did and ran round the puddle sloshing in it, my entire body felt drenched.</p><p>An advert came on for anti-wrinkle cream, and it showed how the womans face changed. I was momentarily terrified by the weird monster that was suddenly in my room with me, then the advert finished. I'm sure I did a lot of other stuff too I just can't recall it right now, I remember how I never wanted the feeling to end, it felt amazing. Later, I was still very much tripping, there was boxing on tv and a man was on the screen who had blood gushing from his head. The blood looked so amazing, I stared in awe at it. It was the moment I'd seen the blood that the visuals got REALLY hectic.</p><p>I was standing in the middle of the room, looking at the tv, and I was melting again and was just playing with the ooze that came off me as I stood there. The colours on the tv went MAD. the colours in the image were always as varied as the normal colourations, but were not the normal colours at all, and as soon as it was in one psychedelic colour scheme it was changing into another colour scheme. I watched a mans eyes go from a sulphuric orange, to a powerful purple, through bright red to luminous yellow in a matter of seconds.</p><p>I began to feel like the effects were wearing off, so I decided to go downstairs where I could smoke. The corridor looked WEIRD, it gave me the same sort of feeling as the weird woman creature from the tv, a deep down feeling of 'Ugh that is so wrong somehow.' I got downstairs and saw myself in a mirror. Whoa, my eyes were huge, the pupils huge gaping holes, and watery round the edges. It struck me how cute they looked that way, set in a face that kept warping and distorting, like a flag in a breeze. I looked at my mouth and it was flushed such a deep vampiric red, and my lips were glistening. Overall, though weird looking, I found my mirror image incredibly sexy and gazed at it for a very long time.</p><p>I finally got to my smoking room. One halloween years ago, we bought a ghost to hang up that goes WHOA! when you shout at it or hit it, and it hung in the corner, to annoy the neighbours mostly. A red light came over the room and the ghost passed from one side to the other in front of me, just drifting along, I watched it curiously, as it watched me. By the end of my rollie the trip was over.</p><p>The trip itself lasted about 2 and half hours, and they were 2 and a half hours of exhilaration and euphoria. I lay on my bed for the rest of the night just thinking about what I had felt and done, I couldn't sleep. From what I've read about mushrooms, I think that that was a level 3 trip. For some reason I did not manage to get to sleep at all until the following night, and I spent A LOT of time unable to stop thinking about the amazing shrooms. Best intoxicant ever in my opinion.</p>",
