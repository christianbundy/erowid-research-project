 "report": "<p>Im in my house, in my room. My friend Anthony sits beside me. He has just finished his trip, and wants to do it again right away. I sit down on my couch, my open window on my right; my cast is resting on my leg. Its a nice sunny day. In my hands are a pipe filled with 1/6 gram Salvia 10X extract and a lighter. Im nervous. I notice my hands are already sweaty.</p><p>I light the lighter, and dip it into the bowl. As I inhale, I see the leaves catch fire, and I feel the smoke enter my lungs. I inhale slowly, so as not to cough, and take in as much smoke as I can. I have finished roughly half the bowl in one hit. I give the pipe to Anthony so I wont drop it. I hold the smoke in as long as possible, for about 20-25 seconds. Almost out of breath, I dont feel high enough, so I go to take the pipe back from my friend. He is smoking it, wanting to get high again. I shake my head at him, and point to the pipe. He gives it back. I exhale my first hit. I light the lighter again and just as I finish taking another hit, I go.</p><p>There is an image of my cast and the outside of my house, or possibly my bed. The image is coming towards me. Behind the first image is a second image, exactly the same as the first. The images come towards me, and then go past me. Over, and over and over again, the image comes towards me, in a seemingly infinite LOOP. I dont know who I am. My life is the loop, and all I know or have ever known is the loop. I see the side of my house, and decide that Im supposed to be a house. But I cant be that house, because the image of the house keeps moving, but never stopping on what it is.</p><p>I know I want to stop, and be who Im supposed to be. I try to stop the loop, but I cant. I notice that there is something on the left that will help me stop; to get out. If only I can move there, I will be out. But I cant get out. If I try to move left, the loop follows me. I strain to remember who I am. I cant, all I know is that the house is me, and if I get back to it, I will be safe. I strain left again. This time I see the grey of my friend. But I dont think hes my friend. He is the guardian of the loop. I know he wont let me out. I settle back into the loop.</p><p>Its really starting to scare me; I dont like how repetitive it is. I try once more again to get out. This time, I move over, and up. Im standing, and out of the loop! It seemed as though I had been in there my whole life; that all my life had been was the loop. But now I was finally out!</p><p>However, when I stood up, it seemed as if the floor behind me was tilting down, and the floor in front of me was tilting up, as though the floor was straining to curl over me, swallow me and take me back into the loop. Then the grey guardian stands up. Im afraid he is going to take me back. I walk out of my room, and walk up the hill that the floor was creating to swallow me again. I walk as far as I can in my house, to get away from the tilt, and to make sure I really was back to normality, and not still in the loop. I quickly walk all around the house, looking for any signs of the loop. I cant see any.</p><p>My friend is following me, saying my name. Ive come to accept hes not going to bring me back to the loop. But who is he? What is this reality? I cant remember it. I just want to do something normal, get out of the craziness. But my friend wants to do salvia again. This scares me. I think that if he does salvia again, I will go back into the crazy trip again. I say no. I try to remember something normal to do. I want to eat. But then Id have to feed my friend. This also scares me. So I pull out SSBM, and we start to play. Hes much better than me, so immediately I dont want to play anymore, but I want normal, so I endure. After about 10 minutes of playing, and thinking about my life while playing, I can remember who I am, and who my friend is that Im playing with, and what the real world is.</p><p>I start asking questions about my trip. I can remember most of what happened after I stood up, and the time involved. But I want to know what I was like whilst I was in the loop. He tells me that about 5 seconds after I took the pipe from him, I stood up. I was astounded. In that time, I had taken a second toke (which I dont remember exhaling) and had been trapped in a loop for what had seemed like forever. That loop was the peak of my high, and it had lasted approximately 5 seconds, with the confusion and aftermath of that trip lasting approximately 10 minutes.</p><p>I am highly grateful the peak did not last longer than 5 seconds, because I felt like I was going insane. I am also slightly surprised it lasted no longer, because I had just taken a second toke, and the usual length for a trip is about 3-5 minutes. I really do not feel like going back to the realm of Salvia. It is a very surreal and scary world.</p>",
