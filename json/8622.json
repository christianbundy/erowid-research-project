  "Hello, my name is Alan. Recently I have been experimenting with marijuana and alcohol. You could say I'm not that experienced, but I'm experienced enough to know what's going to happen to me physically and mentally when I take those drugs. Just prior to the first time I ever smoked pot, my friend (Jay) and I were desperate to get high so we decide to try benadryl.",
  "It was quite a night. We were at a friend's house begging him for some pot, but he was fresh out. We had heard that you could get high from nutmeg or poppy seeds so we ran down the grocery store to pick some up. Poppy seeds were too expensive, so we got the nutmeg. Once we arrived at Jay's house we researched the nutmeg further only to find out that most people received negative effects and that it could last for up to three days. We couldn't afford to be feeling disgusting or messed up for that long, but luckily we came across a website explaining about the benadryl high. We thought he had some in his cabinet, but of course with our luck there was none, so we ran down to a nearby mini market and bought the biggest box they had of benadryl. The check out lady was really attractive and I think she knew what we were up to because she gave us a funny look.",
  "Anyway, once we got back to his home we were really excited. We decided to pop 12 of the tablets, 300 mg. We each popped twelve then commenced to play crazy taxi until the effects hit us. We were both really nervous soon after we took the pills. We started to think we might have overdosed, even though that is pretty irrational because we read about people who have taken much more and had been fine.",
  "The high had two main elements to it. Both of these elements hit us at different times. The first element was a dizzy, sick, drunken feeling. It sort of came out of nowhere, about 20 minutes after we popped the gems. Not very pleasant, but it wasn't to the point where we were going to throw up. It felt very much so like when I've had too much alcohol and have a SLIGHT urge to puke. Also, my hands quivered a lot, but Jay's remained calm. We walked around in his room a bit, disappointed about the effects.",
  "The second, more pleasurable element, came about five minutes later. Again, it came out of nowhere. Slight euphoric feelings, nothing compared to pot, as I now know. We began to stare into space for long periods of time. It was as if nothing was going through our minds. We just sat and stared for long whiles. We didn't much have the will to do anything else. We were extremely stoned and out of it. Short term memory was terrible. When we did speak, which we did rarely, we often forgot what we were saying in the middle of the sentence.",
  "Eventually, we had the idea to go downstairs and get some vodka to enhance the effects. As we went downstairs Jay claimed to see a mocking bird sitting and chirping on the balcony. I didn't believe him at the time, but he said it was definitely a hallucination. By the time we were downstairs, we sat and stared for more, then decided we didn't want any vodka so we went back up to his room.",
  "This is where hallucinations started for me. We sat facing each other, although we were not looking at each other, we were staring into nothing again. I saw a dancing hippo appear beside Jay, and I told him about it, but all he did was look over his shoulder, then regain his trance. I saw several other things, such as balls and jets flying through the air. All of the hallucinations were cloudy, and usually pink or light blue. They were pretty interesting, but for the most part all I wanted to do was stare.",
  "And that is how most of the high went. We stared and stared. Eventually got in bed, and I stared at the ceiling for who knows how long and hallucinated more.",
  "I don't think I'd ever do benadryl again. It made my stomach feel too uneasy. The hallucinations were great, but I don't think it's worth the uneasiness. If I want to hallucinate, just smoke large doses of good weed, which I personally can hallucinate from."
