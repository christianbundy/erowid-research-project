  "Heard on the news about the two lads dying from Mephadrone use, instead of putting me off it gets my intrested, and I look on the websites about its uses and how to get some, got some Mephadrone from the internet a couple of days later, but I also received .5gram of Methylone as it was going cheap.",
  "Worried about taking the Mephadrone so I opted for its softer alternative instead",
  "It was a Saturday afternoon and my son was out playing with his friend, Wife was out shopping with my elder daughter, so I thought I would give it a go, I had read reports that it would calm me down and so what better time to do this than a Saturday afternoon, as watching football always gets me agitated.",
  "5.25pm .25Gram taken orally with some 100ml of water. tastes like bitter asprin but not undrinkable,",
  "6.15pm Doctor Who has just started and I have an overwhelming feeling to go out and find my son in case he misses it.",
  "6.20pm feeling very mellow, but in control, unlike Alcohol or Cannabis, find Son and tell him he is missing his favourite program. Feeling a lot of Love for my Son, so I give him a big Hug.",
  "6.40pm The New Doctor Who is a lot better than I expected, But cant make out if its because I am feeling a lot of Empathy for his first Time being Doctor Who and feel sorry for him, or is this due to the Methylone and really he is a load of Pants, Jury still out on that one.",
  "6.50pm Wife and Daughter back home, feeling very concerned and needing to show them some Love ",
  "7.30pm Feeling great, very calm, not agitated, as I often get on a Saturday, I think this is because it is my day off and I never seem to get any peace, so I start to resent the people who dont give me any peace, which is usually the kids, and in the end, I finish of the evening by getting in a mood and shouting at everybody.",
  "8.pm, High has worn off now, but still feeling very relaxed and at one with things, realise what an absolute Arsehole of a Father I have been recently, determined to mend my ways and think more about my Wifes feelings and the children a lot more and be a good dad like the one I wanted when I was a Child.",
  "11pm Made Love to the wife, but with a lot more consideration and less rush than Normal, God this Methylone is great and now the Government is going to Ban it, not Voting for them this Year, interfering Arseholes"
