 "report": "<p>I met up with some friends and we decided to go party in the mountains of Costa Rica. We went up there, about 32 km away from the city, a perfect party place. It was about 2:00 pm, and we were all happy.</p><p>We set up the DJing equipment and immediately I came up with the idea of seeking shrooms since there are cows in the lawn. We didnt find any, as the excessive rain let little sun set the appropriate temperature for them to grow.</p><p>Frustrated as we were, we decided to drop some acid. We did, and I dropped half a hit. I began DJing, mixing some stomping goa to warm us up. A friend I met that day came up to me with some pills, Nootropil (Piracetam), said to have a powerful enhancement on psychotropic drugs such as acid. I dropped 3 orange pills (Nootropil), hoping I would have a good trip. That was at T+1.30.</p><p>As I began to mix the stompiest goa I have, the effects kicked in. It was a good trip, the good vibes seemed to come from everywhere. I met a guy, and within two or three looks on the eye, I knew we would have a great trip together.</p><p>And this is where I lost the notion of time. I was in a timeless environment, I forgot there was such thing as time.</p><p>We seemed to focus on the same details of the trip, laughing at exactly the same things. Explosive laughter, which creates a chain reaction. Sometimes I would try to explain something I thought or vice versa, and by saying 4 or 5 words he would perfectly understand. Hours later, we had discovered we were extremely attached to each other, and we were acting as One. At night, we decided to drop some xtc. I dropped half a pinky. It was the first time I did x, and I thought doing it while tripping must be great. I didnt feel anything for about 40 minutes. At that time, I went upstairs to find out the rest of my friends were laying on the floor, in a chill out bliss. I sat with them but felt a little uncomfortable, so I went back downstairs to sit in an armchair. Morg sat in front of me and asked do you feel it?. I replied I didnt, because I hadnt felt anything acid hadnt made me feel before. I started to feel anxious, I smoked a joint and relaxed. Morg repeatedly touched my knee and said do you feel this now?. When he was doing it, I didnt feel anything unusual, but upon removing his fingers from my knee I felt a direct connection with him, and a growing feeling of bliss. I started to play with the wind, because it felt incredibly good. It made me extremely talkative. Once I stopped talking I realized how how I was.</p><p>He suggested me to stop talking for a while, but when I did it, I tried to talk to him mentally. I was very surprised to find out I could, and everytime I did it felt like energy flowing throughout the spine and giving me extreme pleasure.</p><p>Later on, he and my friends decided to drop another 1/2, to which I couldnt agree to because I had no money and no pills left. Morg sat next to me and said I couldnt take more x without you, youve been my trip partner and I need you to go up with me. He gave me a full hit, and I took half of it because it was my first time and I was afraid I could OD. I didnt notice much difference, except for a couple of rushes where I couldnt stop trancing with pleasure. One hour later, we decided to drop the rest of it. Thats where I became demented.</p><p>The acid trip was unnoticeable at that time, but the connection with Morg was growing and it didnt seem to stop. As of then, I could see in his eyes what he was thinking, and we could easily communicate telepathically. I decided to let go of everything and enhance the trip. I mixed some more minutes, and left a mixed Oakenfold CD playing. I went outside to find out I was alone, but my friends were about 50 meters from the house. I walked up to them, and as I appeared we all hugged together, it was a fivefold hug. I felt intense pleasure, almost orgasmic, and found out that place, by the woods, was an energy spot. I walked up to the house, and Morg ran up to me and yelled I cant believe how hard Im tripping! Dude, Im still tripping, this is unbelievable! As he said that, I felt all the acid multiply its effect exponentially, to the point of extreme delirium. And that happened in about 20 seconds, an incredible rush. I was hit so hard I immediately began to hallucinate... 11 hours after dropping such a small amount of LSD.</p><p>But the weirdest part of the story, is that Morg and I fusioned into a Perfect Unity, to the point of hallucinating exactly the same things at the same time. It was a collective trip, something unbelievable. We first saw a hole in a cloud, like a black hole, the cloud sucking itself inside, but coming out from the other side, like an organic structure, it had a cycle. The black hole slowly evolved into two perfect Niagara cascades, one in front of the other. It was so detailed I could see the trees around it, the waterfalls, the evaporation, the rocks, everything in full colour. We were screaming in ecstasy because those waterfalls were intensely beautiful. All of a sudden, ALL the sky split in two, with a tidal wave effect -Moses-like- when he spreads the oceans in the bible. This happened with a rain of energy, I could feel drops of energy going inside me, it felt incredibly good. When the show ended, I looked at Morg and shouted DID YOU SEE AND FEEL AND HEAR THAT???? to which he looked overwhelmed at me: dude, dont tell me you just saw a blackhole which morphed into two niagaras and the sky split and the rain!!!</p><p>We were so shocked by that we just hugged intensely. That hug felt incredibly great, totally blissful. Thats where we realised we were going in a sort of a cycle. We had a loop: 1. we went out the house with The Joint (it was sort of sacred, dont ask me why). 2. we sat on a bench, smoked one or two hits, talked for a minute or two. 3. we had an intense hallucination. 4. we went to the energy-point where we had all hugged together. 5. we hugged intensely and had an illumination, kind of an answer to the trip. 6. we went back inside the house, and upon entering it, the vibes of the music and our friends rushing, we would rush all the way up and rush them all up as well. 7. we talked to them about our trip and had a good laugh.</p><p>That loop, we did it at least 20 times uninterruptedly, each time hallucinating stronger and stronger. Once we saw a huge metallic sphere, with red crossed bars and airplanes, YES, AIRPLANES, inside, outside and everywere. I swear we saw exactly the same thing, and I felt Morg see the same thing.</p><p>We came up with a theory: rushes come in loops. Therefore, our loops must be the same frequency and hence in phase. Thats why we had so much energy, our trip was in fact a multiplied trip from his and mine. But the people inside the house had rushes in cycles that didnt match, so there was kind of a permanent high ambient inside the house, due also to the dreamtrance that was playing. The loop we did together was a representation of the cycle of our rushes, so thats why we always hallucinated at the same bench and felt everything identical.</p><p>I once got connected with the Moon. Everything seemed to produce its own vibes, and I could lower or heighten my frequency to be in phase with them. I got connected with the trees, the rocks, the bushes, the people, Morg intensely, and as I look up to the sky, I saw the most perfect Moon I ever saw. It wasnt full, but the details were so subtle I immediately reached up to it. I felt it try to reach me, and I saw MY HAND MORPHING INTO THE MOON, which had by the time the size of half my visual field.</p><p>It was unbelievable. A sort of Love where only the spiritual is important, physical is insignificant. A direct connection, a perfect Unity.</p><p>The trip only seemed to keep on multiplying its amplitude, we were having an extreme fantastic delirium, supernatural demency, ecstatic and peaceful bliss, orgasmic interpretation of all signals, catapulted creativity.</p><p>We were in a different world. When the sun finally started to rise, I felt weeks had gone through, as if my trip had lasted about 45 days. One side of the sky was dark, the other one was light. This made us very confused, and we assumed it was about 5:30 P.M!! but instead of going down, the sun was going up! The sky began to dance with the music.</p><p>We decided we needed to sleep, and upon closing our eyes we had lots of visualisations we shared by thought.</p><p>I still dont believe the intensity of that trip, the connection, the loss of the notion of time...</p><p>In the morning, we felt so good we decided to pick up ALL the thrash there was in Nature, since she had given us such an unbelievable journey. We picked up every single cigarette butt, and watched the sky and the flowers smile at us for doing such a kind thing. I felt happier than ever, since I love the Nature.</p><p>Today, days after the epic journey, I still feel myself rolling from time to time, mostly when I smoke weed and listen to trance music. I feel connected to Morg even though I met him that day. I know a long and lovely relationship is born, which makes me internally smile in bliss.</p>",
