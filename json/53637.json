 "report": "<p>I came into possession of an eighth of mushrooms. They were a bit overpriced but due to the rarity of these magical fungi I was more than willing to pay. This would be my first time tripping and I was more than a little excited to finally experience the notorious journey I had heard so much about.</p><p>We had been planning on going camping with some other friends who also were going to be tripping that night, but as fate would have it we ended up going to another friend's house who had an open house for the weekend. The setting was a large house in a small town neighborhood. My friend who owned the house, Charley, was having several people over who planned on drinking and having a high ole time. My fellow tripping friend, we'll call him Gary, and I ingested the mushrooms around 7:45pm. I decided to take only half an 1/8 but my buddy munched the whole godamned thing. I expected to have a mild trip due to the smaller amount ingested. Directly after eating them we smoked a bowl and sat down in the living room to wait for the initial effects. I began to feel cramped and claustrophobic in the rather large room. A feeling of anxiety clawed at the pit of my stomach.</p><p>I stood up and suggested to Gary that we should take that walk in the woods. The cool evening air felt great and the open space was very suething. As we walked along the sidewalk I noticed a colorful spiraled shell pattern on the side of a stone wall. As we continued on to the woods, I had a bizzare feeling of walking sideways, like I was walking along a very steep hill. Some people were playing basketball across the street and I felt as if they knew I was tripping and I began to have strange thoughts. I almost felt as if I was in a Disney cartoon and could break out it a corny song any second, with bluebirds chirping and all. We got to the woods. Gary had at this point no clue where we were, and was sweating profusely with a very freaked out look on his face. We made it to the woods safely, but I began bugging out and called Charly to come pick us up. We waited for several minutes and they arrived with some random people I didn't know in the car. They were carrying on a conversation about something or other, but interpreting social interactions had become uncomfortable although I tried to seem at least partially aware of what was happening by uttering forced laughs at things that the others were laughing at.</p><p>We arrived back at Charly's house and an overwhelming feeling of anxiety began to cramp my brain. I was pacing back in forth in the kitchen wondering why I would ever have wanted to trip in the first place. I gave the remaining shrooms to Charley and told him to keep them safe for me. I then pleaded with him to remind me never to eat mushrooms again. I retrieved a coke from the fridge and went and sat down with the rest of the people in the living room. Everything was just to much, to overwhelming. I wasn't having any visuals yet, but Charly's friends words began to sound like complete jibberish. This insanity was really freaking me out, so I grabbed Gary and when went and got some fresh air on the back porch.</p><p>Gary at that point had lost all touch of reality and had no idea of who or where he was. I lay down on my back on the porch and tried to think straight. I kept telling myself I would be fine in a couple hours and was just tripping on some mushrooms, but time had lost all meaning. The open sky began to have a negative sinister feel to it so I rushed back into the house and plopped down on the couch. I began to feel uncomfortably hot and took off my shirt. The room had begun to pulsate with green and red colors, and Charly's face started melting into itself. I could only think of how bad I wanted it to stop, but it just kept becoming more intense.</p><p>I asked Charly with much difficulty to put on some acid rock. He played some Jimmy Hendrix and Led Zepplin. I began to relax and enjoy the trip as Jimmy's guitar overpowered my senses. The notes created intensely colorful visuals that would shift and morph with the music. I began the journey into my subconceince. I lay on the couch realizing just how amazingly big my mind was. I saw myself as a black and green dragon, constantly morphing into different shapes and dimensions. I realized I was a strong person and could make it through anything. This realization was a huge relief and I stopped fighting the trip and just let go. I left my body and my ego was washed away by the light. A giant stone sungod entity hovered over my head. It took me under it's wing and as if to protect me from all negativity. It was a female entity. I don't know how I knew this but I just knew. I flowed with the universe. The universe, time, and space all flowed as one. It was the most beautiful feeling. Everything was in perfect harmony. There was no 'I'.</p><p>After this feeling of intense euphoria I began to contemplate my life. I could feel my hands and only my hands and they were small blue mushroom huts, where my family lived. I realised that the purpose in this uncomprehendibly short life of ours was to find a soul mate. I realized that material possessions meant nothing and a person's soul is all that matters. I thought of my family and I saw all of us together floating as four blue bumps in a black void. Each of the bumps was the entity of my family, and we were connected in a different dimension. It's very hard to explain but realizing this felt like a great weight was lifted from my shoulders.</p><p>After journeying through many more amazing dimensions and realizing many more of life's questions (sadly I can't recall) I began to drift back to reality and the room in which my physical body was located in. I opened my eyes and began looking around the room. I asked Charly what time it was. 10:30pm. ONLY 2 HOURS??!!! It had felt like a lifetime. I began looking around the room. Everything was morphing into rediculous shapes. There was a couch in the room with a interflowing flower pattern on it. All the flowers began to flow into each other. This couch was giving off an awful vibe and began to wig me out. I began to look around the room and noticed that a girl I had never met was sitting at the computer. Several more girls showed up and attempted to have a friendly conversation with me. I could give no more than one word replies and the conversation soon died to silence.</p><p>An awfully awkward vibe filled the room and my trip started to go sour again. I began to look around the room and greatly enjoyed the amazing colors radiating off all of the morphing objects in the room. Everything was morphing so fast it was all to much for my mind to comprehend. A small blue half moon appeared on the lower right side of my vision and began spinning around hectacly. Some more people showed up with the movie Grandmas Boy. I moved to a different seat and tried to watch the show. I couldn't concentrate on anything more than 2 seconds so none of it made any sense to me. I watched in bewilderment as David Spade's face folded in on itself.</p><p>I began to come down and the visuals began to become less intence. I began comprehend time again and social interactions became much more fluient. Gary was just comming back from his journey as well. We looked at each other and a feeling of joy poured through my body. We made it, I thought. We then went out onto the back porch and chilled under the stars smoking cigarrette after ciggarette. I wasn't so much smoking them as just staring at them with a childlike wonder. I looked into the trees and the branches began to form words. Another hour passed and I felt pretty much back to baseline, but a bit fried. I went and lay down and had a relatively easy time falling asleep.</p>",
