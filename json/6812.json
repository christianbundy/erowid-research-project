 "report": [
  "I was a seasoned mushroom and salvia tripper, until I had a major psychotic episode. Got diagnosed bipolar and put on lithium. I also converted to Mormon so I had been pretty sober for about 7 months before trying 2C-I. ",
  "This happened about three hours after dosing.  After a while we went and played Halo 2 and I started to hear these echoes. It was like I was recording sounds from the outside and looping them in my head. And for a while I could control this but at about 4 hours into the trip I couldnt take it anymore, I felt like I had gone completely insane. Then I passed out.  My friends told me later that my memory of passing out was really me going into a seizure. After this my heart stopped beating and I stopped breathing. I was turning blue, and my friends were about to call 911 when I started breathing again.  I don't know how long it had been but I came to and my friends luckily had Xanax on hand, they gave me two pills and I layed down in my friends bed and passed out for at least three hours. When I woke up I was a little shook but didn't feel that bad. My friends then explained to me what happened and I could believe it. ",
  "Anyway I felt obligated to post my story. And I want to make it important that all three of my friends did the same drug and were fine. And I was enjoying the drug up until the echoes got out of control. But I believe this happened to me for three reasons: one I am VERY sensitive to hallucinogens, two I am Bipolar which can influence psychotic episodes under stress, and three I am on a high dose of lithium which I have read may have intensifyingly adverse reaction with strong hallucinogens like acid. ",
  "Anyway, everyone knows their own body the best, and looking back I should have done this drug on so many levels. But if you have two of the three risk factors stated above I would steer clear of this drug.  Now I react very strongly to hallucinogens so my friends only gave me a light dose of 17mg of 2C-I. I had taken my last lithium dose about 36 hours prior to dosing on the 2C-I.  It took about an hour and a half before anything started to happen, but I had eaten about 30 minutes before I took the 2C-I. During that hour and a half I was begging my friends to give me more cause I didnt think I took enough to get high, but they wouldn't give me more (and thank God they didn't).  Just as I was beginning to trip, I took a hit of some dank cali herb, which set off my visuals like crazy. I was seeing hard core scales on everything, nothing was staying the same color, and there were snake-like things slithering all over the place. Also the frame rate on my vision went really low, so everything looked like a strobe light. Like I said I'm a seasoned tripper and I was able to enjoy all of this.  Be safe. :|"
