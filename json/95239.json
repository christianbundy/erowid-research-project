 "report": "<p>[Erowid Note: While the author at first reports the substances used as DPT and 5-MeO-DPT, he later reports obtaining DPT and 5-MeO-DMT. 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DPT are different substances. The first substance used is categorized as 5-MeO-DMT based on contextual clues, however, because 5-MeO-DPT is mentioned in the initial paragraph, the identity of the substance is unclear.] </p><p>Background tryptamine drugs especially. This report is mostly about DPT, but also contains a little information on 5-meo-DPT experience I had during the same time frame, within days of each other, which for me might be significant since I rarely do this anymore. I had always had positive effects with hallucinogens. I ate a lot of Hawaiian Woodrose seeds when I was a teenager. I was a loner and suffered from bipolar depression- mostly depression- and this drug made me feel very connected to the universe, everything, and everyone in it. Something I intensely did NOT feel otherwise.</p><p>I did not have access back then to mind drugs other than pot, which made me very paranoid and antisocial.</p><p>I have since done mushrooms about ten times, always with amazing effects. Again, I had a great love and connectedness with everything and everyone. I did acid several times. Depending on the setting was incredible or a little too much; was a little too long and intense with lingering closed-eye visuals for me compared to psilocybin. But overall I enjoyed it- never, ever had a bad trip.on any of these substances.</p><p>In my early twenties I became addicted to Meth. For about a year. I was working long hours doing construction and was introduced by a coworker. I had never really heard about the disastrous effects (this was the early 80s, Bay Area). I got myself out of that, got back in school, became pretty successful, etc. All during this time I had cycling moods, periods of great depression, took mood stabilizers, antidepressants and occasionally Valium or Xanax.</p><p>In grad school I substituted working out for drugs. I had always been very unathletic, but I discovered that I had a talent for endurance sports and became an elite triathlete, training many hours per week. After several years I started having chronic injuries and obtained Percoset to help me train through it. Pretty soon I was an on again, off again opiate addict, favoring IV Oxycontin but using every kind of pill, pod, patch or whatever I could get.</p><p>During a clean period about 7 years since I had done any psychedelics, a friend made a connection and asked for some DMT. Instead, he was able to get some 5-MEO-DMT and some DPT.</p><p>We tried the 5-MEO first. My friend vaporized a very small amount out of this aluminum foil horn-like thing we had devised. He tried it first. He took a very small pinch an placed in on the foil then took his hit. He did not initially look high or otherwise affected. I tried talking to him and he told he to wait, that he had to enjoy this. He described as a mild buzz.</p><p>I put a much larger (10x)pinch, perhaps 15 mg or more on the foil, and despite his warning about the quantity, took a huge hit, vaporizing it entirely all at once. Immediately, the foil turned green, condensed to a ball, disappeared and I fell into a giant white hole with no hope of escape. I had no vision; completely blind. I started moaning, Im going to die. Why am I so extreme? 'Why did I take so much? Why do I have to do IronMans and shoot Oxy?</p><p>I started rolling around on the floor, my friend trying to help me. After what seemed like an eternity, but was only about 20 minutes, I started coming out of it. I felt a hint of mushroom-like warmth and feeling of familiar trpto experience. This lasted for another half hour or so. I was pretty shaken up. The next couple days were difficult. I questioned my life, and my compulsion and addictions. I had minor closed eyed visuals for two days following.</p><p>Even so, of course I needed to try the DPT. From all accounts it sounded mellower- or at least friendlier.</p><p>We first insufflated a small amount of powder- sorry, no mass measured- a moderate sized line each. After 15-20 minutes we were both coming up. Music sounded like a part of me- more so that with psilocybin, even though the effects were relatively mild. After a while we wandered around my yard, looking at things-ordinary things like leaves were fascinating. Without a log book, I cannot say how long the effects lasted- perhaps 2-3 hours. from lift off to almost complete come down.</p><p>The second time was the wild one. My friend had experienced the effects, found them interesting, but decided not to indulge anymore. Two weeks following our first adventure, I loaded up 150-200 mg in a saline solution, filtered it through a 0.2 micron filter and injected it deep into the side of my buttocks. I was alone this time, but was used to tripping alone. I knew not to expect visitors so was relaxed in that knowing I would not have to handle anything but the trip.</p><p>The effects came on fast and strong. I sat on my bed and decided that so long as I could stay in that friendly environment I could ride it out no matter what. I had candles in the room and it was soothing. I was in a good state of mind: excited to see what the increased dose would do.</p><p>At twenty minutes, I was seeing very intense visuals. I had never experienced visuals to the degree many people do. Most of mine were pseudo hallucinations that consisted of intricate patterns. These DPT visuals lit up in intensely bright neon- almost exactly like the old black light posters of my youth and then intensified from there. In fact, the feeling and visuals started taking on a 60s kind of theme, with bright poofy fonts of neon writing floating across the wall. I saw Jimmy Hendrix playing the Star Spangled Banner with a an enormous American Flag- too large to fit in any real three dimensional space behind him.</p><p>I reached out for a glass of water on the bedside table and discovered that it had no weight. That there was no sensation of holding it, even though it was clearly in my hand- a very dissociated feeling. From there, I left the room, and then the earth behind. I was deep, deep, in the void. More without than within, as if I were deep in the universe, were time or space really had no meaning. I felt transparent and part of the either. I felt the presence of God everywhere transparent like me. I dont normally think in terms of God, but thats the best word I can think of to describe what I felt. The creative force was all through me and all pervasive in the complete blissful emptiness. It was like the emptiness described by the Buddhists; what I strive for in my meditation, even though the mind was definitely still at work.</p><p>Physically, back on earth, I was still slightly aware of my physical body, although I mostly seemed to be residing in space. I felt a tremendous need to stretch and a sexual need in my hips, groin and anus. I am not gay, and have some limited experience with girlfriends occasionally putting something in me, but not much. I felt my hands working autonomously. I had an erection, and in a physical manifestation of the transparent quality I felt in my mind, also in my body, I started to masturbate while pushing my entire hand up inside me. I felt as if I were being probed by God or vice versa- there was really no difference we were one. When I came, it was indescribably blissful.</p><p>I kept no official trip report so cant report the time when I returned to the point of being able to read the red glow of the clock, and how much time had elapsed.  But it was shorter than a psilocybin experience I am sure. The rate of blast off, intensity of effect and rate of come down were all increased. Perhaps two hours of intense tripping, followed by mellow warmth for an hour or two until bed.</p><p>The next day I felt nothing but wonder. The reintegration was not as difficult as with 5-MEO, although I did have a depleted feeling usually get after taking tryptamine drugs.  What I experienced was largely in tune with what I believe the ultimate nature of the universe to be like after death, so I was not frightened, did not have a lot of questioning of the experience. I was just in awe of the entire trip. I would do it again, although I would probably reduce the dose. I would like to see what mid-range doses are like. Alas, I have no access. Maybe some day.</p>",
