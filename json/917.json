 "report": "<p>After hearing about the crazy hallucinations caused by these motion sickness pills, I had to try them out. I love hallucinations, and have frequently used LSD and shrooms for that effect.  The first time I used dramamine, I took about 10 pills, and about gagged on their taste.  I waited and waited, but nothing happened except for occasional leg twitches.  Shitty, I thought, because my friends had been seeing people, animals, bubbling sidewalks, and I hadn't really even felt it.  I continued taking about 10 or 12 pills about two or three times a week, and still had not seen any hallucinations.  It would get me dizzy and tired, and I would get the twitches so I wouldn't be able to fall asleep.  Then one day I figured I just wasn't taking enough, despite the warnings of my friends that taking too many would make your heart stop.  So, I stopped by the local grocery store and I saw a 24 pack of it.  Quickly slipping it into my pocket, I made my escape and went home to start popping.  I stopped at 18, and decided to wait and see what would happen. </p><p>An hour went by and I started to get the dizzy feeling and the worst cottonmouth I had ever had.  Plus, it felt like I had to go to the bathroom every five minutes.  I went outside to light up a smoke, when the shit hit me hard.  I couldn't concentrate and I thought I heard a high pitched 'Jingle Bells' being blasted through the neighborhood.  While trying to figure out whether the music was real or not, I looked at my smoke carefully and saw that I had lit the wrong end.  Now, this was impossible, I thought.  I remembered putting the filter part up to my mouth, like normal, and dragging it.  I decided to go inside, into the light for a closer look. Sure enough, the butt was charred black.  I decided to lay down for awhile, and suddenly I saw my old dog, who isn't around anymore, jump up on the bed.  It scared the shit out of me, and then it turned into a shadow on my bed. I was happy to be hallucinating finally.  That night I talked to a good many of my friends, who kept disappearing on me.  The next morning, feeling tired and shitty, I knew that I would try the drug again, because I thought I had kept good control of the situation.</p><p>A week passed, and I was fiending to try dramamine again.  This time I decided to take 24 of the pills and just get real fucked up.  I was confident I would be able to act normal, just a little quiet, around my family.  My dad and sister were out for the evening, and returning home around 11:00 pm.  I popped the 24 at 7:00 pm to get some good tripping time in before they came home.  Insanity hit, and the next 3 hours cannot be remembered at all by me.  My dad returned home to find all the doors ajar, all the phone taken off the hook, a burner on the stove on high, and me in the garage holding a hammer in my hands saying, 'I'm looking for the evil animals!'  He found the empty package, which I must have left carelessly out in the open, and took me to the hospital.  I definitely wasn't doing a good job of acting normal, and on the way to the hospital I carried out a conversation with a girl who I thought was in the back seat, all the while thinking I was on my way to school. I kept telling my dad that we could wait ten minutes, because school didn't start until 7:30 am and it was only 7:00 am.  Of course, it was really going on midnight by then. </p><p>When I got out of the car, I waved to my dog who was also in the backseat.  My dad was really worried and told me that the dog hadn't come with us. I don't remember the waiting room, but while I was lying in a hospital bed I entertained myself by watching a TV playing a soap opera up in the corner of the room.  When the doctor came in the TV abruptly disappeared, but by this time it was no shock to me.  Shit was disappearing left and right.  I didn't know who was real and who wasn't.  I expected everybody who talked to me to eventually disappear, and a lot of them did.  After drinking a cup of charcoal the nurses supplied me, I came down a little and was somewhat coherent.  It was an incredibly shitty experience, but at the same time I enjoyed it immensely.  However, even now, I still have a hard time seeing everything as real.  I keep expecting it to disappear.  It seems like I've done some permament damage to my brain, and I will never touch that shit again.  For those of you who wish to try this drug keep in mind that the hallucinations seem very very real, and that could be a dangerous situation to put yourself in.</p>",
