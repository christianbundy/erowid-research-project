 "report": "<p>I ingested 2 tablespoons of very old ground nutmeg in succession, with water in between. The taste wasn't nearly as bad as what i'd expected based on other's reports on erowid. I didn't really know what to expect. After about a half hour, I started feeling a bit light headed and hot. Stuff felt a little off, and it was weird looking at my computer screen. However the feelings were fleeting. Almost a soon as I got a good chance to recognize them, they dissapeared. This continued for about an hour. The height was when I layed down on my bed to meditate a bit. Almost as soon as I closed my eyes, I felt the intense motion and lack of body space which normally requires about an hour of breath meditation. I felt like I was spinning in my bed, and couldn't tell what my limbs were feeling, or if they were there at all. I opened my eyes to see if i would still feel it but alas, it was over as soon as I saw light. I found that it immensely assisted the ease of intense meditation. There is definietly something there, and I will definietly try it again sometime, with perhaps a bigger dose, or fresher nutmeg. </p>",
