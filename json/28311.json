 "report": "<p>I started using Zyprexa about 2-3 weeks ago after being on alprozalam for a cannabis psychosis after figuring out that the alprozalam didnt help much. I have audio hallucinations and I have thought that there was a camera inside my room and that all people were against me, I cant go to any place with many people as I tend to panic and get offensive (aggressive).</p><p>After I started on olanzapina I am more calm have less audio hallucinations, I feel more like myself as I was before my addiction to cannabis, its of course also because Ive stopped smoking hash. I have smoked since I started on anti-psychotic medication, but it has helped me in a funny way, when I smoked I could see my mental illness in a very clear way and I felt at total peace with myself. It helped me in that way cause now I know my psychosis better, I dont have any plans on smoking again ever, even though I may smoke a little (one hit or so) when my psychosis has disappeared totally. But I'm not sure. Not at all. Im happy that I stopped smoking. cause when I did I had nothing to live for, now I may have something left, Im only 16 and have alot to live for. I thought my life was over...now it's time for medication.</p>",
