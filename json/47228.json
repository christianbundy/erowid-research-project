  "<p>All the reports I've read here about fentanyl seem pretty negative or not very positive, so I'd like to share my experience with this drug.",
  "I got the gel patches for free a few months ago, 4 patches to be exact. I decided to be stupid and eat the gel inside. I took a little drop at a time, put it on a paperclip, and stuck it under my tounge. 5-15 minutes later I would do more until I had the desired effects.",
  "Anyhow, I loved this stuff. It made me feel pretty damn euphoric, as well as relaxed. Eventually when I went to bed it seemed to have psychedelic effects, the same every time. I would always hear voices having conversations or see shadows move out of the side of me eye...stuff like that. I enjoyed this a lot and it was a fun way to get to sleep every night. Around this time I would also get pleasently itchy if I had done enough.",
  "I continued use 3 days in a row, a 2 day break, then 3 days again etc. The first patch lasted into the second cycle, but by the end I was using half a patch a night. I took a break for about a week when I only had one patch left, but I still had a high tolerance when I came back to it.",
  "Recently I tried oxycontin and I found the effects extremely similar, oxy just had more of an itch. The only problem was I needed 80mg of oxy to feel the effects much at all (common doseage is 20), and that's snorting it. So watch out for opiate tolerance, cause fentanyl does that well. I felt myself always craving that taste when it was gone, and I might have gone through a minor withdrawl (only 2 weeks of use, so it may have been a sickness).</p>"
