 "report": "<p>Ive been a chronic drug user of one sort or another since my early teens.  For most of my life the drug of choice has been pot, or any derivative thereof.  While I quit smoking cigarettes twice now, I always end up putting tobacco into my joints, which after a while, started to lead to some long-term paranoia.  After lighting up Id start freaking out about how Im slowly killing myself etc.  To make a long story short, I decided to finally quite smoking pot.  I still use it in various edible forms, but not every day.  However, the abstinence had some strange consequences.  I became much more interested in other drugs.  Ive always had a predilection for downers.  Ive chipped at heroin a bit, used valium recreationally, pot chronically, alcohol on occasion.  You get the idea.</p><p>Anyway, not having hook up for any hard opioids, I thought Id give the codeine thing a try.  I had a root canal procedure and was prescribed a very generous amount of T3s.  At the time I didnt think about it much, as I was still smoking, but now the pill bottle has become rather interesting.  I like to think of myself as a rather safe (and paranoid) user.  I started off with 2 T3s on an empty stomach just to try.  I had absolutely no tolerance and found the effects quite pleasant.  Relaxing, but also subtle, as most of the other reports have described.</p><p>The following week (I have a once a week rule with opiods, i.e., I dont use more than once a week) I tried 3 T3s and 4, 222s.  (222s are a Canadian OTC brand containing 8mg codeine, caffeine, and acetylsalicylic acid (i.e. aspirin)).  I had heard that the euphoric effects didnt manifest below 100 mg of codeine and thought this might be a nice next step to see if I could experience anything more significant.  For this, however, I used the codeine-extraction method.  I know I didnt need to because the ACET/aspirin does werent high enough, but like I said, Im paranoid.  I lay down to watch a movie with my girlfriend.  I had also dosed on an empty stomach.  I noticed the first effects within half an hour of drinking the codeine-water.  The effects were much like taking two T3s but stronger.  I was more relaxed, more calm.  There was about 5 minutes of true euphoria, but then that was gone not to return again on that trip.  I have to add that I noticed the effects more when I got up and walked around than lying down.  I also had a crampy stomach, not really pain, but not necessarily pleasant.   </p><p>The next time I did an extraction using 7 T3s.  If I didnt lose too much codeine I should have had around 200mg (210mg if it was perfect) in the water.  Of course, there is no way to tell, but I certainly had more than in either of the two previous tries.  About 10  30min in I felt even more calm, and more relaxed than the last time.  Again I was lying down, and again, when I got up I really felt it.  There was no euphoria to speak of though.  This might also have been because 1. I didnt follow my once a week rule and may have had some tolerance, and/or 2. I didnt extract as much as I thought.</p><p>The problem came later.  I was trying to go to sleep about three hours after dosing.  I couldnt.  Not only could I not sleep, but my heart was pounding like crazy.  I thought it would pass and tried to ignore it.  I wasnt able to, and started to panic a bit.  I knew I hadnt taken nearly enough ACET/aspirin (even if I hadnt done the extraction) to OD, but yet, I was sweating, my heart was beating out of my chest, and my thought I heard ringing in my ears.  These are classical OD symptoms for ACET/aspirin.  Of course, I wasnt OD-ing.  I was rushing on the caffeine which cant be filtered out in the codeine extraction.  This was rather unpleasant.  My body was very relaxed, but by CNS was screwed on caffeine.  I dosed at 9pm, and managed to get to sleep at around 4am.  I had to work the next day. </p><p>Knowing now that I was not OD-ing, I will gladly to it again.  However, I dont think I will do much more than 200 mg of T3s unless I can get some without caffeine.  One more note:  the constipation really sucks.  I usually plan on not taking a shit the next day, and sometimes for more than that.  My friend, however, has diarrhea whenever she doses T3s, so you may want to reckon with either.</p><p>All in all worth doing.  Perhaps heroin or opium is a better buzz and in the end, less hassle, but for a cheap nice easy enjoyable night T3s certainly do the trick.</p>",
