 "report": "<p>A few weeks ago my days and nights were really getting turned around. I was staying up until 7 or 8 in the morning and sleeping until 7 or 8 at night.  I had heard about some things to help you get some sleep.  So one night I went to do some shopping.</p><p>I picked up a jar of Kava Kava Root(850mg per capsule), a jar of Melatonin(300 mcg per pill), a jar of Valerian Root(1,605mg per capsule), a jar of St. John's Wort(300mg per capsule), a jar of Vitamin B-6(50mg per pill), a box of sleeping pills with Diphenhydramine HCl(25m per pill), and a jar of Nerve Tonic.  Quite a load, I was proud and ready to get home and down to business.</p><p>Now I'm not sure of my exact recipe and dosage of each type of substance that night, but I don't think it really matters. Any combination of at least two substances with at least 3 pills did me pretty good. I tend to like 5 kavas, 4 melatonins, 5 valerians, 2 st. johns, 4 B6s, and 3 or 4 Nerve Tonics.  The actual sleeping pills do put me to sleep, but I have found detract from the dream aspect(which I will get into in a minute).</p><p>I mean I sleep every day, so every day I have a chance to try a new formula. Personally I feel all the drugs listed above are key players, if I had to shorten the list, I would take them off in this order: sleeping pills,St. John's Wort,B6,Nerve Tonic. Those are what I would part with if I had to. The other three(kava,valerian,melatonin)are a must. Also I didn't like having to give up the Tonic and B6.</p><p>Anyway, I previously described my usual formula for a great night of dreaming.  With this recipe, I have experienced the most real and entertaining dreams I've had. What I mean by real, is that I get so invovled in them. I really feel like they are happening.  When I wake up, I can remember so much of my dream and enjoy the memories they create. In a way they are so real they become surreal. I've had dreams where once I wake up,  immediately think I have to do something, that I'm late for something, or think I'm somewhere else than my room, and I then realize that that thing was just my dream. And it is such a great feeling to just revel in the fact that I don't have to do something, I'm not late, and I am in my room. I have also found that I have more control over what happen in my dreams. I can't necessarily create a whole experience so much as dictate what I do in a situation. It's not like you're watching from the sidelines any more. You can think and reason wht you are doing or what yo want to do. On the wierder side of things, there has been a dream or two where I saw into the future. I saw things I would do that day and things that would happen, and I did those things and those things happened. It creates the most pleasureable feeling of deja vu because I can remember the dream from the night before.</p><p>In short, sleeping(dreaming) has become one of my favorite things to do. My days and nighs are back to normal(although some nights I do turn in a little earlier. Just to get some extra dream time. The way I see it is I have to sleep and in turn dream, why not make it a better experience.</p>",
