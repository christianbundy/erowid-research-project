 "report": [
  "First off, I would like to say that, as I'm sure you all know, everybody reacts differently to drugs. In no way am I implying that anyone, whether an experienced user or first time user, should take the amount I did.",
  "One reason why I take drugs is due to the fact that I love to hallucinate. The idea of seeing things that aren't there, or simply watching things float around you is truly amazing to me. So one night, not having access to any illegal substances, I decided to get 3 boxes of Dramamine, each box containing 10 pills, and each pill consisting of 50mg of Dimenhydrinate. I had done dramamine twice before, hoping to hallucinate and talk to imaginary people, but each time was horrible. I would get the twitches where I can't sit still and I just can't relax, a truly horrible feeling. However, I was desperate and that bored.",
  "So that night, before taking the pills, I decided to go to a bar and get a few drinks to help me relax. All in all, I had 3 long island ice teas, so by the time I left the bar I was quite buzzed and relaxed/ready to give dimenhydrinate one more chance.",
  "Around 2:15 am I took 15 dramamine. I then waited for it to kick in, which usually takes around 30 minutes to an hour. By 3 am, I was feeling good, but not entirely fucked up. Becasue I was still buzzed from the alcohol, I decided to take the other 15 pills. By 3:30 I began to feel quite fucked up.",
  "I put on some mellow/down tempo music, sat in the dark and stared out into the night. However, after a few minutes of looking outside, waiting to see if I would begin to hallucinate, I began to grow tired and I decided to lay down and just listen to music. Like before, I couldn't be still while laying down in bed. I was constanntly sitting up waiting to feel relaxed before I would lay back down. Also, as a side note, my stomach felt like absolute shit, probably becasue of the mixture of the pills and alcohol. I also had trouble swallowing/breathing. It sounds weird, but my throat was so dry that when I tried swallowing my spit, it would get caught in the back of my throat, blocking the air passage as well. Bugged me out a little.",
  "Now, for the best part. Around 4:45-5 am, I sat up in bed again, waiting for my body to feel relaxed when I looked around the room and saw my Japanese friend sitting in one chair, while my Swiss friend was lying down on the couch with another Chinese friend of mine. I turned away from them, not knowing why, but I looked out my window and saw two figures dancing on air. The figures weren't clear enough to make out who they were, but I could tell they were dancing. I just stared at them for a while. Finally I looked away and back towards the doorway of the room, when I saw a woman walk in and go into the bathroom. I knew only she wasn't real becasue she dissapeared fairly quickly.",
  "However, when I looked back towards the couch and chair, I saw my friends sitting there again. My Japanese friend asked me if I was ok, but the funny thing is she didn't speak, it was alsmot as if I could read her mind. When I tried answering her, it was so hard for me to talk. I opened my mouth, but nothing would come out. Finally, I was able to say 'I'm ok,' but it took so much energy out of me. I had been drinking water all night so at one point I had to get up and go to the bathroom. Before I went to the bathroom however, I walked over to my Japanese friend and realized that it was my jacket. As for the couch, there were only pillows. However, I was so fucked up that it didn't register with me that what I had seen before was simply hallucinations caused from the pills.",
  "All in all, I probably got an hour of sleep, and the next day, I was so retarded. I tried talking to my parents, but I would constantly forget what we were talking about midway through the conversation. My stomach continued to feel like shit and I couldn't eat all day. Despite the physical problems, I was so impressed with the pills. This was my first experience in hallucinating and actually thinking that what I was looking at was real. I was so convinced that my friends were really there in the room with me, and for whatever reason, that just amazes me."
