  "I tried salvia for the third time yesterday.  Wow.  The previous two experiences were but mere glimpses into the real realm.  I took one good sized bong load and held it inside for at least 15 seconds, as i started to exhale it hit me.  Totally unique experience, nothing at all like any other psycadelics i've tried.. Salvia  is the first tryptamine that i have ever ingested and there was no way for me to even try and comprehend was was to ensue.",
  "Five seconds into the trip, the entire room/world/universe completely disolved and all that was left was energy, raw energy.  I couldn't comprehend that there had ever been any other way than this way, this was how the world was, and had always been.  I immediately forgot that i had smoked any salvia at all, just all of a sudden i found myself in this realm where i was energy, in the music, in the air, the light, even my motion.  This energy force i had become could move around, both mentally and physically and everywhere i would move my body, or arms, a force of energy would carry me there.. I melded entirely with the music, at one point i recall saying to my friend Renay, this song is saving my life.  It was as if the song playing (They Love Each Other)was my soul being layed out before me. ",
  "As the effects slowly wore off and the song started sounding more and more comprehensible in ordinary reality i knew i was going to return to my normal mental state and had been given a glimpse into a whole new dimension. Truly the most astonishing substance i have ever experienced."
