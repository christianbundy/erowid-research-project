 "report": "<p>I just recently moved to Colorado and was needing to get a new job, so I was looking for some legal substances to fill the marijuana void.  I was not about to jeapordize a good job prospect with a failed drug test.  I was looking on the Internet and found a host of legal drugs that I never knew existed.  One of the most common was a substance known as lettuce opium, conveniently called legal hydroponic buds by most of the sites.  It was relatively cheap for a decent sized bag, so I did some looking around a found a reputable site that looked like it sold some quality product.  The pictures of the buds looked great, allmost like real weed.  A few days later the stash arrived while I was at home, so I loaded up a bull and smoked it, not really expecting much, but a bit excited nevertheless. </p><p>The smoke was a bit harsh, and I had a tough time smoking the whole bull just by myself.  I was in my car with Weezer playing in the background just waiting for something, anything to happen.  After about 5 minutes, I began to get butter-legs and my body felt very relaxed.  I started giggling a lot, kindof like with marjuana, but the laughy feeling passed after just a few minutes.  For the next twenty or so minutes I just felt very relaxed, but not much else.  Never did I experience anything more than slight giggles and relaxation.</p><p>A few days later, not wanting to admit that I had spent 25 dollars on a waste, I thought that maybe one bull wasn't enough.  I took a full half of a bag (1/4 oz. approx.) and ground up the buds, and spread them on a slice of pizza.  I had a large glass of water at hand.  Honestly, it didn't taste that bad, the buds didn't really taste like much of anything.  I thought that if this much stuff doesn't cause any effects, the stuff is not worth the money. </p><p>It took longer to kick in, but after about 40 minutes the feelings returned.  At the time, it was the night of July 4th, I was watching fireworks.  The same feelings returned that I had had before.  I felt very relaxed and started giggling a lot.  But once again, after a few minutes the laughing passed, and I just felt very relaxed.  Pretty much the exact same as one smoked bull, and I was a bit surprised, given how much I had eaten.</p><p>Overall, I would only reccomend ever buying the stuff if you want something to induce some pretty good relaxation, but then you actually have to put up with the harsh smoke.  With lettuce opium, I would not expect any sort of marijuana-like high.  Very mild, and in my opinion, save your money for the real stuff.</p>",
