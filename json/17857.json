  "So, I have taken LSD in the past, and had good and bad trips.  I hadn't taken it in two years.  Then, this summer I decided to drop one hit, which was supposedly pretty strong.  I didn't trip that hard, but I had some visuals, and I smoked pot and I drank too. ",
  "The trip ended after about 8 hours.  That night, I smoked pot again, and I noticed, no visuals, but everything that was close up looked really blurry.  I couldn't even read a book.  I looked in the mirror and my pupils were very dialated, so I thought maybe the acid was like coming back, since I smoked.  No big deal. ",
  "Then, the next day, when I smoked pot it happened again.  Now, I was getting kind of worried.  I also noticed that when I wasn't high, I could not see close up very well.  My pupils looked to be a normal size.  I thought, maybe I have permanently damaged my vision and I was really worried. ",
  "I told my mom about it, not that I took acid, but that I could not see close up, and she said that I might need bifocals.  Bifocals at nineteen years old.  I felt really bad.  This went on for a few weeks. ",
  "Luckily, my vision got better, and now I can see close up just fine. ",
  "Thank God, because I was really worried that I did something to my eyes.  I will be more careful from now on!"
