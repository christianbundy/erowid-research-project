  "pure fiction....i swear ;-) drugs are bad.",
  "ok so i had a good time with 2C-T-2 the first time i tried it. i took a 20 mg dose and was happy (electronic bliss is what i remember it as) So being the adventuresome individual that i am, i decide to combine some of the 2C-T-2 with some mdma. here's my story",
  "10:30pm New years eve in chicago at a club event. ingest 1/2 of a yellow rolls royce",
  "11:15pm feelin speedy and full of energy",
  "11:45 slight body buzz, still dancin my ass off",
  "12:05 another 1/2 of the yellow rolls royce",
  "12:30 rollin balls. feeling really good. you all know how x makes ya feel so i'll get to the 2C-T-2 part",
  "3:30am back at home. feeling body buzz from the X still. take a hot shower and POW the X feels like it's kickin back in.",
  "3:35 ingest ~20mg 2C-T-2. and lay down listening to some paul oakenfold",
  "4:00 feeling the familiar effects of t-2. kaliedoscope effects, sensual feelings while listening to music, warm glowing sensations",
  "4:25-10:00am uh oh. this is getting real weird. suddenly everything has this strange drone to it. like a metallic buzzing sound. try to imagine the sound of electricity humming thru overhead wires amplified about 5 times. i cant lose this sound. i close my eyes but it wont go away. there are no beautiful images or sensual images. just sheer fuckedupedness. i can't concentrate on any one thing long enough to enjoy it. the humming is acting like interference blocking my mind from flowing freely. i'm chewing some gum and clenching really bad. sleep is nowhere in sight. i get up and walk around in the dark for a while. i have distinct open-eye-visuals. those are cool. lots of red lasers shooting around. there were some auditory hallucinations as well. every sound was amplified at least 5 times. i couldn't lay still. every time i would lie down i would find myself kicking my legs around. i would tell myself to calm down but it was not working. my thoughts made no sense and i was starting to freak out. i would bounce back and forth from my front room to my bedroom trying to fall asleep but to no avail.",
  "10:30am decide to give up on sleep. still getting some morphs i turned on the TV. this is bad, very bad. feeling alone and really fucked up. looking in the mirror and seeing my own face morph was very strange. i cant remember what i did for the next hour and a half",
  "12:00pm i decide to go to the drugstore to see if the pharmacist can recommend something for clenching or sleep. they don't know much about any phenethylamines and recommend going to the emergency room. i was very tempted at this point to go but i decided not to since being outside in the fresh air kinda mad me feel better. it was very sunny here in chicago yesterday and the warm sun almost washed away the shitty feelings.",
  "1:00 pm got back home. back to baseline. now just feel like shit. very nauseous, very tired but cant sleep and my jaw was aching. layed down on the couch and watched the cotton bowl and was finally able to get a little sleep around 2:00 or so",
  "i thought this would be a good combo but i guess not. the jaw clenching was unreal and my jaw still hurts today. the fucked up feeling was too much and i do NOT recommend this combo. i wonder if a lower dose of 2c-t-2 would have been ok. i'm not willing to find out any time soon. surprisingly enough though i was not depressed just really hung-over for lack of a better phrase. i was finally able to eat at around 3:30 or so. i napped thoughout the day and slept like a log from 9pm to 6am this morning. i was hoping to review this trip with better results but i guess not.....sorry guys"
