  "One day, Me and my friends decided to se what is was like to get hopped up on caffeine pills. Now, being VERY experience with caffeine, I decided to take quite a large dose. 8 caffeine pills.",
  "At first, I felt no effect. But then it started setting in. It felt kind of like a very mild weed high, but with much more paranoia. This got worse as the day went on. About 3 hours in, I was having panic attacks so bad I swear I was going to die (as it turns out, sever paranoia and panic attacks are symptoms of a caffeine OD). I felt sick, my chest felt tight, and it seemed like it was never going to end. 5 hours in, the symptoms where still very strong, at the end of the peak. It was only at about 8 hours in when I had come down to a state of mind where I could clearly think, and I was no longer shaking. However, it took about 13-15 hours before the effects totally ceased. Needless to say, I will never be doing that again. It is not fun."
