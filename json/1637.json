 "report": [
  "After extensive research, I decided to try the Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seeds.  I ordered 20 grams of seeds, which turned out to be a lot more seeds than I had thought.  Me and my friends B and S went fishing.  B scraped the fuzz from the seeds, which is reported to cause nausia and took 8 seeds.",
  "We returned to B's house, where we picked up a case of beer which we intended to drink if the experiment fizzled.  We then went to S's house for the night, and me and S scraped 10 seeds each, ground them as best we could with forceps and a meat tenderizer, soaked them in cold water for about an hour and drank the water.",
  "B had reported only uncomfortable feelings, but no major effects.  Within an hour, S and I began feeling quite tired and sick.  I laid with my head down for about 30 minutes, half asleep.  It was then that S decided to get his mom to take B home, and I walked to my house right up the road.",
  "As soon as I stood up I began feeling very strange.  I walked home in a thunderstorm, very slowly, stopping in my yard to have a cigarette.  I went inside, said goodnight to my parents and went to my room. ",
  "I went to my computer and played mario for super nintendo on my emulator in slow motion, which was qutie entertaining.  I then watched david letterman, who had jackie chan on the show, and burst out laughing for no apparent reason.",
  "After watching some TV I noticed that when the screen briefly went black, looking out the windows was strange.  I turned the TV off, leaving no lights on in the room, and watched the thunderstorm for an hour with a huge grin on my face.",
  "I did not experience any visuals really, I would describe it as a euphoriant rather than a hallucinogen.  Overall, I would say it was very pleasant after the nausea wore off.  I called S the next day and he said he had the same kind of experience.  B only got sick.",
  "From this I would recommend to anyone trying them for the first time to use a cold water extraction rather than chewing the seeds.  And don't expect an acid trip, it is NOT acid, but it is a very interesting journey."
