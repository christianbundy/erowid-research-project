 "report": [
  "When my sister's friend came over, and told me that he was going to be picking up an 8-ball of coke in an hour, and that I could try some, I was absolutely thrilled.  For a long while I had wanted to try this drug, having heard only good things about it. ",
  "As the minutes went by, waiting for it to arrive, my anxiety mounted and mounted.  I was nervous, as I usually am before trying a new drug, but I had never remembered being this nervous.  When he produced the small baggie full of white powder, I felt as though my heart skipped a bit; it was no longer just talk, I was, for certain, going to be trying cocaine, my first really 'hard' drug in just a few moments. ",
  "The tension peaked as he finished cutting up the line (which I thought was very small, but was assured it was 'fat'), and handed me the rolled up dollar bill.  Now for the moment of truth:",
  "I insufflated slowly, the drug burning somewhat, but nothing terrible.  I had expected to be flying as soon as the drug entered my nose, but felt nothing.  Of all the substances I have tried, I'd always done my homework on them first, but the one drug generally considered to be 'hard', I had researched nothing. ",
  "Another line, and another went up my nose, both of which were said to be large. ",
  "I felt...something, somehow.  And it wasn't sudden either, as I had been expecting.  I felt slightly energized, but paradoxically sleepy as I lay on my bed.  Quite a bit more talkative, but the urge to talk went unnoticed until I thought back on what I'd been saying.  I sat for a bit, not talking to anyone, not really sure what to make of the situation. ",
  "Sure, the other three had had one more line than I, but I didn't think that could have made such a great difference.  They were jumping around, giggling, rubbing their faces on my blanket...how one generally behaves on Ecstasy. ",
  "Slightly disappointed, I went upstairs to go read, and found that my mental clarity was improved noticeably. ",
  "A few hours later, I felt sleepy enough to go to bed, but when I did so, I had great difficulty in sleeping, and tossed and turned for what seemed like hours.  It felt as though my heart was hammering, though the mental effects were not so dramatic. ",
  "As I sat there, I heard what I thought to be loud whispering outside my door.  'Could it be my sister's friend?  Had she overdosed?  There was a lot of coke there, they surely were going to take it all in one night. ', I thought to myself, growing somewhat frightened.  The whispering was becoming louder, and quite obnoxious.  There were steps outside my door as well, and I began having disturbing thoughts of someone...or something, being out there.  Completely irrational as they seem now, the thoughts I had then seemed totally logical. ",
  "But as I sat longer, the 'whispering', I realized, was only our small dog scratching on the door to be let out to pee, and the footsteps, turned out only to be the creaking of the house in the freezing weather. ",
  "All in all, it had been much less than what I had expected, and somewhat unpleasant with regards to the paranoia. Perhaps this first time was a fluke."
