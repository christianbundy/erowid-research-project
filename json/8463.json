  "I have been very experienced with valerian root as a relaxing and sometimes a sleep remedy. For awhile, when I was a frequent cannabis smoking, I would take it in hopes for relaxing effects. But I've found if Im wanting to get stoned, or taking it and waiting anxiously for effects, the anxiousness from either can cancel out or just dull them severely to where you hardly notice. I experimented for months, feeling very little and I finally gave up on V. root until after I quit smoking pot for two months and my grandmother suggested that it was really good.",
  "I purchased some and took two capsules, somewhere around 1000 mgs, and didn't expect much. My intentions were not to embark on any sort of trip or feel better, just relax. After awhile of going out on my usual nightly tasks I began to notice I was a lot calmer. I felt a mild sense of happiness, and a slight feeling to talk to someone. The effects were not strong, but yet pleasant. Very nice and subtle."
