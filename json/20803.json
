 "report": "<p>\n[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</p><p>This is a journal entry from last year:</p><p>'I had a very powerfull experience tonight. I started off by eating around 600mg DXM. We went out and purchased a bottle of ethyl chloride (maximum impact), and two 24 count boxes of whippits. I started filling balloons for my friends and watching them enjoy the wonders of N2O. Then I decided to inhale some of the magic myself. I filled one balloon, placed it in my mouth, and filled another. I inhaled both balloons, one right after the other, then proceeded to inhale ethyl chloride. I blacked out. I was starting to gain consciousness and everything was echoing. All the people around me where laughing. Finally I was 'baseline' well, conscious at least. I thought I had enough so I called my girl friend and told her to pick me up from the gathering. I decided to voyage one more time. So I did the same thing again.</p><p>I completely blacked out and was placed into the awareness of myself as a child. The same imagery and memories kept repeating. I usually see pictures of my childhood while on nitrous but not this vividly and not this far back. I heard a voice say 'is this what it takes to wake you up!?' A bright white flashed and I was tunneling and spiralling back to a semi-aware state. I heard the other people at the party trying to wake me up. I thought I was dying. I screamed really loud then started crying. i finally came to awareness. It felt like being pulled out of a pool after nearly drowning to death.</p><p>The spirit of nitrous oxide told me that its time to retire. I've learned a lot from these substances and to continue to use them would be dangerous for my psyche. It's time to move and put faith in myself.</p><p>I would like to add that the use of inhalents is very dangerous alone and in combination with other drugs. I learned this first hand tonight. I feel as though I completely shut off air flow to my brain and it literally turned off. Please be carefull when utilising such tools.</p><p>The thought of that experience really creeps me out. Just the thought that I was so careless and ignorant about those drugs angers me. To this day I still haven't (ab)used inhalents. Please be cautious when ingesting any substance.</p>",
