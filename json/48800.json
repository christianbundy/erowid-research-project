 "report": "<p>I would not consider myself, now or ever, to be a heavy drug user.  I didn't touch any substances whatsoever (including alcohol and cigarettes) until less than two years ago.  Since then, I am now a pack a day smoker, a quasi-regular drinker (1-3 nights a week), a regular user of marijuana (depending on the time of year and course load, anywhere from 3 to 7 days a week), and very rarely experimenting with mushrooms.  However, this is intended as a summary of the handful of experiences I've had with the white lady.  My good experiences have outweighed the bad.  Take that as you will.</p><p>My little story started around 6 months ago, when a very good friend of mine called me up and said he would be around to pick me up.  I assumed he had just gotten weed, as that was his usual reason for such calls.  He arrived in about 15 minutes, and we started driving.  Once we had gotten sufficiently out of town, I pulled out my bowl.  My friend told me to put it away, that he had something different in mind.  With a huge smile on his face, he pulled a very small bag of white powder out of his pocket.  The bag itself had a skull and crossbones on it, which in itself was enough to give me sufficient pause.  I then looked at him a little more closely, and noticed his eyes didn't look right, and he was shaking a little.  Nevertheless, he seemed in amazing good spirits, and asked me if I wanted to try coke.  Being an experimenter at heart, I consented, and he handed me a cd-try and told me to cut myself a line.  I cut a very small line (likely less than .05g), and not being any stranger to insuffalation (I've snorted various prescription drugs at times) rolled up a $5 bill and downed it.  I then cut one for him, and he did likewise while I took the wheel.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>I sat in the front seat of the car and waited for it to hit me, expecting a high feeling similiar to marijuana.  Within seconds I felt my lips go numb, and began smiling broadly.  I thought it odd, however, that I didn't feel 'fucked up'.  If anything, I felt better than ever before, like I was invincible.  So began my affair with coke.</p><p>After that night's experience, I would get together with said friend (and only that friend) maybe once a month, when we had a little extra money, and buy and split a small amount.  We rationed it out carefully, often making 1/2g last for 2-3 days, and genuinely enjoying ourselves in the process.  We would often dose before parties, and I would feel much more open about talking to and meeting new people. I'm a relatively shy person by nature.</p><p>The experience at hand, however, happened not too long ago.  After moving away to college, I happened to wind up talking to somebody shortly after I had split a 1/2g with my friend from home.  He being a user himself immediately could tell, and since then we had a pretty good friendship.  My relationship with friend #2 was much like with friend #1.  We would get a small amount when money permitted, use it, and sit back and talk with whatever group of people we were with (these people all being users themselves, one's group of friends expands greatly at school).  It was always a laid back, casual, and very enjoyable experience.  We would mostly discuss religion, sports, news, politics, perhaps drink a little beer, and have a good time.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to these good times that I began to lose respect for the drug.  I forgot just how potent and dangerous it can be.  It was in this mindset that I, along with friend #2 and another acquaintance, procured 2 grams at a very reasonable price from my usual source.  She (my source) warned me that it might be a little more potent than what I was used to, but I didn't really pay attention.</p><p>Immediately after getting it, we began cutting rails, often more than four, five inches long.  We each took one such line, all in one hit, and sat back and waited.  While relaxing on the couch, I began to feel very very hot and dizzy, something that I wasn't expecting.  I took off my jacket and overshirt, but I was still sweating profusely.  At this point, I told my friends I needed to go outside, get some fresh air, and smoke a cigarette.  As soon as I got outside, I began to dry heave violently.  I hadn't eaten anything all day, so there was nothing in my system to vomit, but I couldn't stop heaving anyway.  The nausea finally subsided after about 15 minutes, at which point I sat down on the front step and lit up a cigarette.  Friend #2 came outside and asked how I was doing, if anything was wrong.  I said no.  Let's call that mistake number 1.</p><p>After going back inside, I made mistake #2... I did another line, just as big as the first one.  Shortly afterwords, my hands began shaking, constantly, and that would continue for the rest of the night and well into the next morning.  After we each had used approximately .4g apiece, my two friends both said they needed a break for awhile.  They went into the other room and began watching tv.  However, I couldn't help myself. I sat down and did line after line for about an hour and a half, until the remaining .8g was gone.  When I walked into the room where my friends were sitting, I must've looked something awful, because they both expressed deep concern as to my well being.  I continued my assertion that I was fine, I was fine, and they dropped it.</p><p>Fast forward about four hours, and they are still sitting around, not doing much, complaining that I had used all the coke, and they wanted more.  Friend #2 began making calls to try and get another gram.  While this is happening, I am pacing back and forth, endlessly, unable to stop moving.  While I lost track of time, they told me the next day that I paced back and forth for a good four hours, even when outside smoking, I couldn't stop pacing.  I never got to sleep that night, and couldn't sleep until approx 4-5 pm the next day, when I managed to get a small amount of marijuana.  As a frame of reference, we took the first line at just a hair after 10pm.  Furthermore, my hand kept shaking until well into the day after that.</p><p>The point of all this is that cocaine can be a hell of a rush, and can make social occasions enjoyable for all.  However, one needs to respect the drug.  I haven't used it since that experience, and will never buy more than half a gram at a time again.</p>",
