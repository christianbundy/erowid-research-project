 "report": "<p>Having finished my exams, a buddy and I decided to drop 'party pills' being sold in a local head shop. The packaging had explicitly stated not to double drop, and though this was tempting, we figured that 400mg of bzp/200mg of TFMPP over the night (2 tablets taken separately) was probably enough. </p><p>It should be noted that i had been drinking (which i generally NEVER do before MDMA), over a stretched period from about 12am to 7 or 8pm, as i was celebrating the exams being over, but i was not drunk, and i waited about 2 hours after my last drink before ingesting. I was smoking nice pollen and weed for the duration of the experience, but this is a norm for me.</p><p>Having taken MDMA in its pure form many times, we weren't expecting much. Legal highs here generally are the equivalent of multivitamins or herbal boosts, which i barely notice, certainly not like 'proper' drugs.</p><p>However we were suprised. While it  took a while to come up(i reckon about an hour and a half), the affect was noticeably similar to MDMA.However there was no 'vibrating eyes' MDMA affect when coming up (an intense darting of the eyes, which i actually quite enjoy), and the rush was not as intense at all. I wasn't as loved up, and i had more visual affects, trailing and both open and closed eye visuals. The visuals at times were almost similar to a low dose of LSD or even baby woodrose seeds, colours around the edges, patterns etc.</p><p>My buddy was very chatty with some other friends of mine who he wasn't too familiar with. He also ranted a great deal (though not in a non-sensical way) about the various problems in the world. </p><p>I was more quiet, i felt as though i could probably talk at great length, but didn't really feel like it. I was enjoying the warmth, in a similar way to mdma.(I don't generally dance or anything while on MDMA, and i felt no need to on these pills, i much prefer to listen to music).</p><p>Music was good though! Definite greater appreciation of the bands i generally listen to while on MDMA, plus new bands that we had been talking about in relation to being good 'MDMA music'.</p><p>The foremost buzzy feeling i felt was a kind of rush in the head, a warm feeling, sort of felt like sparks in the mind. I had a match of a popular soccer video game with a drunk friend that called over, and i was well able to beat him despite the rushes and distortion of visuals :D</p><p>We dropped another tablet about 2-3 and a half hours after we came up from the first tablet. While time was distorted, we found that it was not going as quickly as mdma can. Though i suppose this is completely relative, as oftentimes on mdma i have noticed that the amount time speeds up is dependent on what im doing and who is with me. Time slowed down at times on this Piperazine blend.</p><p>I felt a similar flush to MDMA in my skin, when i touched my face i got the same little tingles that i get while rolling. When other friends of mine had left i found i was able to talk with my buddy in a far more coherent and meaningful sense than on MDMA. Generally on MDMA the conversation revolves around how great it is, how great the music is etc. whereas with these pills we had very interesting conversations about Terence McKenna, theories of the universe etc. However we also spoke about MDMA-like topics, such as family, childhood stories etc.</p><p>I experienced spatial distortion at one stage when i went to leave my friend into my apartment. The lights out in the hall have been turned off for the last few days (with no explanation i might add), and when i was walking back in to get the lift up to my apartment, the hall (a small squareish space between 4 apartments) seemed far far larger. </p><p>However later on in the night i found my speech was affected slightly, and i had similar experiences to MDMA in that i would often be saying something, and forget what i was talking about, or my friend would forget what i was talking about and thus i would forget what i was talking about. Generally i think this is simply caused by the brain becoming tired after a long night of fun.</p><p>I often felt weak on these drugs however, which is fairly dissimilar to MDMA. I would compare the weakness to a feeling i also experience on LSD, or that i often experience later on in the night with MDMA, it simply seemed to take affect far earlier. This could also be due just to being tired after the exams, and the bad sleeping patterns that it entails (i can never sleep before exams). I also experienced light jaw tension, but not as much as MDMA. </p><p>While i compare this drug to both MDMA and LSD, it is not the same as either. I have 'candyflipped' the two, but at relatively high doses, however i would think that a low dose 'candyflip' would be somewhat similar to this drug. Good fun. </p><p>I don't know if i'll do it again, at least for a while. At times i felt my heartbeat was a bit irregular, i felt slightly nauseous from time to time, (though i didn't get sick, as i did on my last mdma experience) and i could not sleep at all. I thus was quite tired the next day, but in no way narky (that said i never am after mdma either, i used to get bad comedowns from street pills, but i no longer take them). I just smoked some joints, chilled out, played guitar, listened to music. Had a few friends up over the course of the day. Rolled into bed that night and had a GREAT nights sleep :D</p>"
