 "report": "<p>\n[Erowid Note: This report is marked as a Bromo-Dragonfly report, but readers should be aware there are aspects of it that suggest the identification is speculative.] </p><p>I'm currently in grade 11 and smoke quite a bit of weed, though I do very well in school and have a job. I've done shrooms 2 times and was really interested in trying LSD. My dealer, and friend told me that his guy was getting 10 000 hits of very strong acid. I jumped at the chance, seeing as how I live in a pretty small town, and though there is acid, its shitty and hard to find. About a week later, I purchased 3 hits of blotter paper with segments of a Super Mario. Me and my friend decide to take one each on Friday night at his house. But were nervous, because we planned to do it at night after his parents were asleep. The next day(Thursday) at work, my mom came in and told me she was going to her boyfriends house for the night, and she would be back at 7am to get ready for work and drive me to school. I decided this was a perfect opurtunity to try out cid, since school was just going to be a trip to the local university to hear listen to a lecture and get a tour.</p><p>When I got home from work it was 9:30, I just wanted to try it out a little before really trying it the next day, and I wanted to me completely normal by 7am. I took the half, and was instintally disgusted by the taste. Pure chemical waste was the best way to describe it. I thought this was odd, seeing as how I had read the LSD is supposed to be colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but I figured it must just be the paper. Little did I know how wrong I was. I waited 30mins, and didnt feel a thing. I decided fuck it. And took the other half then went outside and smoked a joint. When I came inside, I went to check my pupils in the mirror, and nothing. But when I came out of the bathroom, everything looked soft. As it had some sort of fuzzy meterial covering it.</p><p>I then realized I had a very peculiar sense of euphoria,and was starting to feel REALLY high. I went down to my room and my high had calmed down substantially. But after another hour or so, I was fucking gone. I had incredible visuals. Geometric patterns on my walls, a dripping ceiling, lights skittering across my floor. At one point, my posters all drifted slightly away from my wall,and rearanged in front of me. But I had a very nasty, chemical tasting flem in the back of my throat, that would reappear seconds after it was coughed up. And it all felt mentally draining, it was like existing was a chore. I didnt want to die, I just wanted to turn off. Thinking anything was just too much, yet sleep was not in sight.</p><p>The hours flew by, time was completely meaningless. All I wanted to do was sleep, and kept trying, but as soon as I would start to doze, I would hear this horrible indescribable, puncturing,skreeching noise, that would shock my entire body with a wave of terror. I would jolt upward, covered in sweat, and gripping my sheets so hard my hands were white and veins were popping out of my arms. This happened several times during the night, until before I knew it, I looked at the clock, and it was 6:45. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>I was covered in sweat and looked like I had a fever. Then I heard the terrifying noise of the garrage door openning, at 7 I would have to go upstairs, pretend I had sleapt last night and that I wasnt tripping on psychedelic drugs, while driving to school with my mother. I get up and look at my pupils, and they look like gaping black holes, I'm still incredibly high, and still have that flem in my lungs. I somehow manage to get ready without really letting my mom get a good look at me. When were about to get in the car, I take one last look at my pupils, and jesus christ their tiny. This gives me a boost of confidence, and I somehow managed to make it to school, even though I could not understand a word my mom was saying on the ride their, and watched her face melt infront. And untop of that she can tell when I'm baked.</p><p>As soon as I get to school I remember its a fucking field trip. I see a friend of mine, who can instantly tell I'm absolutly gone. We meet up with some other friends who are also going on the field trip, and decide to walk to a friends house first, and get nice and baked. The weed, and friends chill me out ALOT, to the point that for the first time in the trip, I was really enjoying myself. We walk unto the school property as their loading the buses(we were all SUPER) late. I very slowly walk up to the teacher,said these exact words, 'Maaaaaaan, like, what bus should i get on'. I don't really give a fuck, seeing as how this specific teacher told me he had done LSD before, and another kid in my class aays tells him about all the crazy shit he does on the weekends, like staying up for days on speed, or ecstacy. He tells us all we can get on whatever bus we want, so we do.</p><p>The lecture was awsome. Their was a Coffee shop in the building so I was able to wake up slightly, and enjoy my high. After the lecture, a very proper looking women decides to just take me and coincidentally the friends that I had smoked with, on our own tour, and everyone else went on different ones. And this was once again very pleasent, because we didnt really have to listen to anybody. The visual effects were still noticable up until 24 hours in, and all in all I was dissapointed in LSD.</p><p>That is until a few days later, just for shits, I googled Super Mario Blotter, I found that every website I found with the picture of the same sheet, were all about the same story. Of a drug bust in Finland, where they found an incredibly uncommon, and untested drug, called Bromo-DragonFly, which had been put unto blotter. I asked my dealer where the acid came from and he told me Finland. I then looked into bromo and realized that the effects sounded much more fitting then those of LSD. My dealer later told me that he talked to his guy, and turns out I was right. I proceeded to try it 2 more times, under much better cercumstances, and had a much better time, though not nearly as enjoyable as shrooms. And even if I wanted to do it again(I dont) the main source in finland was busted and all the bromo in the city was sold. And Because of this, I dont regret, because its a pretty damn good story.</p>",
