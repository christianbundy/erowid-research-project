  "To get a good understanding of this experience you must first know the history of my relationship with opiates. In the summer of 2003 I had just dropped out of college and came back home. I was looking for ways to expand my mind. My friend Kenny had ordered some poppy pods and brewed up some tea with them. Now poppy tea is the worst tasting liquid I have ever digested, but it was my first experience with the euphoria that opiates bring. I left Kenny's house after drinking the tea and went to a keg party. I had no need for beer, I just sat on the couch an proceeded 'sink' into the cushions. I was feeling awesome the whole night and never moved from the couch. After that experience I was open to all opiates.",
  "That summer there was a surplus of morphine sulphate pills they were 100mg. I began snortin and eating them like crazy. By mid fall the morph was gone but hydrocodone was everywhere. My hook up was Kenny, he always knew where the drugs were. He would tell me of a source and I would supply the money and we would both get messed up. I started off with 20mg of hydrocodone and that sent me to heaven and back, but I was only doing it on the weekends because if I didnt have a full nights sleep, which I never did on the weekdays with my job and nightlife, I would be horribly nauscious for the whole day. Since I was only doing it on the weekends I never developed much of a tolerance or a habit.",
  "This went on for several months until I moved in with Kenny. The first night I lived there I had talked about 20mg not doing much for me any more and he was like try 30mg. Kenny's tolerance was somwhere around 35 or so at this time. So I took three 10mg hydrocodone. I was putting together a tv stand that I had just bought when it kicked in. I started the usual brow sweat that occurs when Im doin something on opiates, but I didnt seem to be that messed up. Then I sat down to watch a movie after I finished the tv stand. Once I finally settled down I got a huge rush of euphoria and felt like I was floating. This lasted all through the night and I was constantly nodding off in the middle of a sentence and I would come to like 30 minutes later right where I left off. That was the best time I had ever had on opiates.",
  "From that day on I began dosing more often like once or twice during the weekdays. Hydrocodone was so easy to get at that time and it was pretty cheap too, but several of my friends developed habits and began buyin up as much as possible. It took me 9 months after that euphoric night before I ever really developed a habit and my tolerance never got above 40 mg. During this time I had moved out of Kennys house and into an apartment of my own. There I didnt do a whole lot of codone unless I was coming down off of a ride such as cocaine of speed, but I was doing that quite often.",
  "My habit started after I lost my truck and didnt have a ride after work. I just started staying home and playing video games and eating codone. Then one day I realized I was taking 60 or 70mg of codone a day! I also found out that when I didnt take it for more than a day I had withdrawal symptoms. I was hooked. I moved in with my friend Jon who worked with me and was also an addict. We bought as much as we could as often as we could. Kennys sister was now the big hook up on codone and it was also her house that I had lived at when I say I lived with Kenny. I soon moved back in with her which was much more convenient for my habit which got up to about 90mg.",
  "Right now Ive been trying to take fewer pills and less often, but completely kicking the habit has been the hardest thing for me to do. Im still trying but its so hard to live without that warm feeling flowing through my body. I was fine until I started taking it every day. Now Im stuck in this cycle and my liver is probably destroyed. The thing I miss most is the days when I could take 30mg and be awesome all night long. I cant get that feeling anymore without taking so much tylenol I either puke or think Im gonna die. I know about cold water extraction, Ive done it before. But its hard to have pills in my hand and wait to take them. In closing all I have to say is drugs are awesome, the addictions that come with them are horrible."
