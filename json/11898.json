 "report": [
  "First a little about myself. I am a very experienced pyshonaut. Having done my fair share of lsd, shrooms (cubes and amanitas) RCS, dmt, x, Mj, and just about any other thing know to man. I have always had a seemingly unnatural high tolerance for drugs. Psychedelics require larger does than most people I know for me to get an effect. I routinely take 2x or 3x the dose of my friends and trip half as hard. So please do not use my dosing for yourself!",
  "The following report was gathered from notes taken during the trip.",
  "Set and setting. I am by myself, save my dog. It is a wonderful fall day, cool and crisp.",
  "9:00am  I head out to grab a biscuit and a coffee, it is going to be a long, but rewarding day.",
  "9:30am  I return home, go to the kitchen and get 75 gel caps.  Sit down eat my biscuit and load gel caps while sipping coffee",
  "10:30am I have now  loaded up the gel caps. Each cap contains .6grm of dried Peruvian torch skin, no core",
  "10:45-12:00 I take this time to swallow all the caps, drink coffee, and take a toke or two of a sativa dominate strain. By noon I have swallowed the full dose of cactus.",
  "Noon  2 pm I watch football. At around 1 my stomach goes a bit queasy, It is bearable, but an alert that cactus is in me. By 2 the colors of the world are just starting to shine a bit brighter. It is at this time that I take the 30mg of 2c-i.",
  "2:30pm-3pm This time is consumed by the come up, the game on TV was now out of my attention. The 2c-I was beginning to chime in its effects, as the mescaline was slowly soaking into my brain. The first 2-ci alert was early only 20 minutes after ingestion. My stomach now roils with cacti. Switched to an indica dominate strain to alleviate the jitters and the nausea that is now omnipresent and will be in some form with me for the rest of the journey.",
  "3pm  6pm. For this period of earth time there was no trip time. During these few hours I was no longer a member of planet earth. I was vaulting between glorious happiness and great sadness in microseconds. Jumping in between realities and overall just lost in my mind.",
  "6pm -9pm. After the initial few hours, things have leveled off. Still traveling through space and time. My 1 yr old lab/boxer was by my side this whole time, anytime comfort or understanding was needed, he was there. He was I feel, my spirit guide throughout the experience. During this time I was able to freely and easily meditate. Life problems and cares unfolded before me. Time was had to hash everything out. Time was forever, yet finite.",
  "9pm-midnight  During this time reality returned. The vivid geometric flowing patterns of the 2c-I and the earthly vapors of mescaline were wearing off. Slowly returning to baseline. During this period my stomach finally settles down, I never had a strong purge urge, but a general discomfort throughout. I will say it took nearly a  ounce of high grade mj to make it through comfortably.",
  "Midnight  3 am next day. I listen to music, sip a little kava to relax, shower, walk the pooch and finally drift off to sleep close to 3 am.",
  "8am next day. I wake at 8, refreshed, in a great mood. I am worn down, my body is a bit rough looking. A bit drawn down from lack of fluids, tired from a long spiritual journey, yet happy and relaxed. The only after effects on the negative side was a bit of exhaustion the next day ( to be expected), my balance was just slightly off, if I spun around quickly I would teeter, but not fall. Overall It was an extremely rewarding experience. I do not remember visions in themselves. I had many, yet remember few. It was a truly wonderful yet difficult experience.",
  "2 days after dose: Health problem, my liver is a bit sore, feeling run down. Sleepy. This lasted for 2 days. It was probably a mild inflammation of the liver, I would guess due to the load of the cacti, 2c-I, mj, and later kava all heaped on it in one 24 hour period. The feeling of happiness and relaxation and ones with the world far outweights the negatives. Cacti is not for the weak stomached. Mescaline is a gentle yet forceful teacher.",
