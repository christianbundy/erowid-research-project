 "report": "<p>It has taken me two weeks to piece together the mental fragments of my most recent adventure with the divining herb.  Most of that time has been spent reflecting on the implications and whether or not I could actually express this in words, but here it is anyway.</p><p>My friend told me that he had some bomb salvia that he gets from a friend of his, super extract, 30x.  We had this grade a few years back and were always trying to find it again due to the stunning nature of the trip it produced.  My wife was going away for the weekend, so naturally my early 20's instinct says, 'GO HAVE FUN!'   We set up my friend's projector with the visualization Milkdrop to add to the experience. We decided to smoke a little weed before taking the journey, there were 3 of us for the adventure, call them Bob and Tom and of course myself.  It was Bob's first time and he was excited, the perfect attitude for divination.  After giving the weed some time to soak in, we packed the first bowl, I had first go at it since I had done it more times than the others.  Also in the room were 2 friends to mediate the trip in case anyone started to freak out and have a bad time.  With this in place I grabbed the butane torch and fired away, taking the whole 150mg in a single bowl.</p><p>Instantly I thought my lungs were ripped in half, therefore coughing was unavoidable.  After what seemed like 20 mins, but of course maybe 10 seconds, I got myself back together and began to enjoy.  I was sitting to the far right of all of the group, so I turned my head to see how the others were doing(by this time Tom was preparing his journey)  As I took in the scene, it was as if I was watching a circus, my friends were drifting back and forth.  Both Bob and Tom's hand had become swollen, almost cartoonish looking.  The whole seen was vibrating, but rhythmically, definitely to the beat of the internet techo we had flowing.  Some one was saying something and while it didn't make sense to me, every word that came out reverberated and made my field of vision shudder, stretch and shake as though reality was ripping at the seams. </p><p>Excitedly I hope in my deepest soul that it would tear apart and reveal the ocean of knowledge and understanding hidden behind, and that it did.  I turned my head to look at the projector on the wall and the world began to dissolve, and as it did I let out a laugh (loud and audible) that shocked me and my friends as I had been virtually silent since the coughing subsided.  As my loud shout of triumph echoed off, the universe was unmade before my eyes and had shrunk to a tiny ball of light hovering in the very center of my being and I had fallen into the void with it.</p><p>Out of the light, a fine mist began to appear and swirl in the void that was my soul.  At this point I realized I was empty and that it was going to make me whole again, it was my guide, my mentor, my sensei of the rebirth of my soul.  The swirling mist began to forms stars, galaxies, each one I could single out and examine down the sand on the beaches of a green and orange planet that had caught my eye.  As the galaxies became more numerous, I began to lose track and told the light that could not watch over them all, it had grown beyond my powers.  At this the light became whiter than snow, nearly blinding me and it showed me the schematics of the universe.</p><p>He demonstrated how all the systems were connected to each other by the energy of life, a power that binds us all together to one another.  So I didn't have to watch over the galaxies because I was the galaxy, the planet and the sand; they were as much a part of me as my arms and legs and the power that flowed through me could be felt through the entire new universe.  Sadly, feeling like it had served its purpose, the ball of light told me to look up, to the surface of my existence, for that was were I must return.  But he also urged me to remember what I had learned and to dwell on it still as we parted ways. </p><p>At this point I saw reality again, the room sort of came into focus, but I could still watch the universe below.  The only way to describe it is that I was merely a ghost haunting earth while my true belonging was in the energy of life.  Slowly my earthly form 'thickened', I kept thinking to myself I must seem translucent.  Around T+15mins I was back to normal, but still reflecting on my experience.  Bob and Tom both had great trips, I will never forget what I saw and what I now know is in me.</p>",
