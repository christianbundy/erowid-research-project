 "report": [
  "I got a hold of a vial of 10x extract and proceeded to smoke it out of a bong. I took a long hard hit, stood up and walked a few steps away and held the smoke in for over 20 seconds. Within seconds, I could feel its effects on my brain, like a dreamy state. My friend held his hand over the bong to keep the smoke from getting out, giving me a second chance to get the remaining smoke into my lungs. I walked over to the bong with a fat grin on my face (I do remember that) and I tried to hit it again while feeling very disoriented. I immediately coughed out the smoke, it was impossible to hold it in.",
  "I felt a quick rush, and then reality faded out, and I felt as if I left my body. I was suddenly warped in the middle of a circle of people. Some had the face like of my friend, some had no face at all. They didn't have legs or feet, just arms and a body and the odd thing was that they were all connected, (like an accordion). They began to throw and toss me around like a dodgeball. The feeling I got from this was extremely intense. As I was being hurled in the air, the circle of people began to rotate like a wheel. They began going faster and I, too was being thrown faster, which was even more intense.",
  "I saw a door beyond the circle and I struggled to break free. I made it over top of them and as soon as I opened the door, there was a quick blur and I found myself back in the middle of the circle again. My view faded out again, I felt a powerful jolt and I found myself back in my body again, back in the real world. Even though I was back in my body, I could not control it. I felt as if the world were a big joke and it made me laugh....hard. I felt a benevolent pull of gravity from all directions, it was quite an odd feeling. I tried to sit down and relax, but my body didn't. I ran off into the backyard. It was damn cold that night and I was only wearing a t-shirt, yet the cold weather didn't bother me one bit. I thought, 'what the hell am I doing out here?' so I went back inside. I heard someone playing a game on their computer and I thought it said snoop doggy dog, but I know that I was just hearing things. From the time since I came back to reality, I felt an incredibly exhilarating body high.",
  "This was an incredible experience for me, I highly recommend it but please take it into fact that this is an extremely powerful psychoactive, and don't ever do it alone.",
  "These are the things that my friend saw me do that I was not aware of doing (I don't remember doing them)",
  "-The first thing I did after I became affected was that I grabbed the lamp post and I said  'I am part of the pole'",
  "-I picked up a piece of aluminum foil and asked, 'what the hell is this??'",
  "-I sat on top of the sink's counter-top",
  "-I kept saying, 'they're not real, they're not real'",
  "-I repeatedly mumbled about 'a game'",
  "-I tore out a cushion from the couch and threw it to the floor",
  "-I walked on my hands and knees shouting gibberish and nonsense"
