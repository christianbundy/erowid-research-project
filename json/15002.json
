I loved my job my friends where great and my girlfriend was the best.  That night she broke up with me. She told me that she still felt in love with her ex boyfriend and at this point she really just needed a friend.  I told her that I understood and left. I felt really shitty.  One of my friends told me it would be a bad idea to do any drugs at this point for fear of me having a bad trip. But I didnt think anything could feel worse then what I was feeling right then.  So I got my friend to grab me 7grams of shrooms. For getting them I gave him 1.  5grams and I had the rest. I took them at 7:00pm.  After eating them I went into my friends room and laid on the bed waiting and hoping to feel better and forget about what had happend that night. </p><p>After 45min I was in full trip.  But it wasnt normal.  I would begin to trip out on textures then out of nowhere I would remember my ex GF.  This continued for 2hours then my friends took me over to a party.  At this point I was having a really hard time dealing with my trip.  IT felt like I was in a bad dream just waiting for something bad to happen.  Everything and everyone, even though I new all of them seemed like strangers to me.  The whole world seemed odd.  I began to notice little things that you would normally overlook.  The only thing I could think of at this point was my ex.  This was 3, 5 hours into the trip.  I stood up and told my friends I had to leave now.  Even my best friends where begining to piss me off. They were acting like they always did but for some reason I was getting agravated with them.  They asked me where I wanted to go but I had no idea. I started to get panicy because I felt bad, everything was strange and I had the urge to leave but didnt know where too.  So I got in my car and told my friend to just drive.  He took me back to my friends house where I started the night off at.  I was now 4 hours into it. </p><p>By the time I got into my friends house I was feeling like a piece of dirt.  Just knowing that tomorrow I couldnt call her or even see her pissed me off to the point where the next person that said something to me was going to regret it.  Everthing I looked at or thought about was making the matters worse.  So before I did something stupid I got up and left.  I just walked around by myself checking my watch all the time. Time seemed to be moving at a slow crawl.  After 5 hours of this I was ready for it to end but it wouldnt.  I didnt know what to do I just wanted the high to be over.  So I went to my car and turned it on.  And just sat there looking at my driving lights.  By this point lights where all intensified.  They where glowing bright and rich with colour.  This was the only part of my trip where I felt calm and didnt think about my ex. </p><p>2 hours later it was all over. I dont think I'll ever do shrooms agian because I know all I'll think about was this bad trip and my ex dumping me.  I would advise against doing mushrooms when something shitty happens to you.  Even though you might think it will make you feel better, it probly wont.</p>",
