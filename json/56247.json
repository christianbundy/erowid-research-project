  "<p>I used to love GHB.  I used to say 'it's not dangerous, just don't be an idiot about it'.  Last night I proved myself to be one of those idiots - I figured my body's GHB tolerance was high enough to withstand the onslaught I put it through last night [0.8 Gs cocaine cumalitive 6 caps G oral roughly 5 alcoholic drinks]. I was spending the evening with my 2 friends 'N' and 'C', both experienced G and coke users.  The night started off at Ns place.  N supposedly found a year-old bag of coke in his winter jacket, so we all did a few bumps, and decided to get some more after the bag was done.  Everyone took a cap of G to fight off the jonesing feeling before N went out and got a half ball (so we could have about .6g each).  He arrived shortly after, and we headed out to the bar.   I was feeling like a sketchbag, so I took my second cap of G about 20 minutes from arriving at the first destination.  This helped to take some of the sketchyness away from the coke buzz. ",
  "We had another drink each and then continued on to the next destination.  (Note:  I know it is dangerous to drink on GHB.   However I decided to have a few drinks anyways, and didnt feel the warning effects because of the cocaine.)  Here I consumed around 3 vodka limewater glasses, and still didnt feel drowsy.  Eventually, the night died down at around 12:30 (this is a Monday night) and we called the night quits.  N and C carried on to their respective homes and I walked a short 3 minutes to my home. ",
  "This is where it gets bad.  I was still buzzing off coke so I didnt feel at all drowsy enough to sleep.  I had to be up for 7:00 for class the next day, and the time was now after 1am.  I took 3 caps of G one after the other, along with two 15mg prescription antidepressants (Remeron).  I remember falling asleep that night.  The only thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital to a nurse saying Im just going to insert this catheter into your penis.  I was disoriented, confused and a bit angry.  I asked her how the hell I got there, she told me I arrived in an ambulance. ",
  "I started to think about how my roommates (5 of them) could have deemed it necessary to call an ambulance to take me to the hospital at 4 in the morning.  After all, for all I knew, I was in deep sleep and ready to bounce out of bed for class at 7 oclock.  ",
  "Anyways, I dozed off after the nurses finished doing some blood work at about 5am.  I woke up, still in the hospital at 8:30 for breakfast.  They released me after breakfast after a stern lecture from my nurse, who has a son my age.  At this point I was dreading coming back home to my roommates.  They are inexperienced with GHB and probably thought I was dead, when I was actually just in a deep sleep.",
  "Boy was I wrong.  Apparently, Monday night at around 4:30, when I thought I was asleep, I was literally running around the bottom floor of the house, banging into walls and furniture repeatedly.  I woke all my roommates up, who were scared to death.  They tried to subdue me but I kept flailing my arms violently with all my might.  They even said I grabbed a knife at one point.  It turns out, they called the cops to subdue me and an ambulance to bring me to the hospital.  They all spent the whole night at the hospital there with me, worried sick that I had suffered permanent mental damage.",
  "When I heard this I nearly puked.  It turns out that my dangerous mixing didnt just put me in a deep coma, but caused a short period of psychosis.  I was apparently doing all this in my sleep.  Right now, Im in my room at 4pm.  I havent left my room because Im ashamed.  Ive only talked to one roommate, who gave me the real story. The rest I owe a huge apology.  That night marked the last night I ever touch GHB, and hopefully cocaine.  If any readers see any similarities between their usage patterns and those described in this story, please, realize that it is going too far.  Dont end up like I did.  You may lose the respect of your best friends, and you may have to have a catheter pulled out of your wang.</p>"
