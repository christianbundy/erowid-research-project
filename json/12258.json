  "So I'm alive but I've died several times in the last 5 hours. I'm still recovering from the most amazing mind-body transformation of my life and I'm still a bit queasy. What I'm talking about is the RAINBOW OF REALITY -- nothing less -- nothing more. I tested it against all possible alternatives and reality is a vortex of which we as individuals have completely no control and of which space and time are continually recreated just like a holograph.",
  "I previously tested salvia against the full-lotus pineal gland third eye. As people know there's a big discussion online about salvia versus dmt. Today I just had a dmt trip by grinding up 3 grams of Syrian Rue and 12 grams of Mimosa -- not exact measurements but it defintely did the job.",
  "I'm just REALLY glad to be back to reality -- or I should say my little ego-trip contrived version of reality. Ah the ego -- what a trip is takes through death and back again.",
  "Anyway so I boiled the stuff down in a quart of 30% lemon juice/water -- for over an hour. Finally the stuff was boiled down to a big gulp and to make sure I got it all I licked my fingers after scrapping them against the quart -- STAINLESS STEEL (I bought stainless steel just for this trip).",
  "Last food I had was the prevous night -- late -- I went to sleep around 3 a.m. from reading the new SECRET AND SUPPRESSED II. Fun stuff -- very fun. My favorites were Kenn Thomas and Al Hidell (both writers I've corresponded with). But there's some other good research tidbits.",
  "Anyway I was getting hungry and was still tired. I wanted to be well rested before the trip -- so I took a power nap -- and after 5 minutes just the spoonful of sludge gave me this really nice total body orgasmic relaxation. I could feel it deep in my toes and pelvis -- and I remembered how this stuff was serotonin based -- and at this point it felt like salvia. But I knew that just that little bit doing that much -- this was definitely going to be fun.",
  "So I woke up after half an hour -- and keep in mind I had the c.d. HEALING DANCE MUSIC OF THE KALAHARI (smithsonian Megan Biesle anthropologist recording) -- playing over and over. I really like this c.d. because it's the REAL DEAL -- even more than pygmy music.",
  "Anyway I quickly drank the concoction and went for a final wizz. Jesus the computer actually censors words it considers to be more than PG-13. haha.",
  "I quick went into full-lotus -- as steep as possible and I waited. I brought an empty pot -- just in case and I put a jacket on my knees so I was toasty. I was on a nice foam sofa pad on the floor facing a window that looked out into a nice tree.",
  "Anyway the light started to kick in - I had my eyes closed and thought that it was from the window. The bliss of full-lotus kicked in -- but NO straight up climax -- just a deep body beyond climax orgasmic feeling.",
  "It was maybe 15 minutes and I started to wonder if the lights would get any stronger -- I noticed rainbows -- which was very cool. But then I remembered (as my mind fought the drug) that intensity is determined by frequency not amplitude.",
  "I started to sweat as the light and orgasmic bliss got stronger. My energy channels were opening up REALLY quick -- and they went straight for the pineal gland. It was f. amazing. The orgasmic bliss was really deep and I kept on in full-lotus but I had to take off my shirts since they were soaked.",
  "This was my first test -- like with the salvia -- was the drug just a mind hallucination or was it also a body transformation -- and the full-lotus clearly proved that this drug opened up my body channels very fast and in a deep way.",
  "I kept thinking -- I just have this one blockage I just wish the drug would clear out -- and at this point the rainbow of reality kicked in. Clearly this isn't a drug -- it's alive and nature is totally alive and the plant was healing me.",
  "Anyway I had to stay in full-lotus to make sure the drug kept clearing out my body blockages and the intensity of the body energy sure enough totally popped the pineal gland -- flooding my brain and my body with the RAINBOW OF REALITY.",
  "At this point I fell into the corner wall and hit my head pretty strong but I was so blissed out and still in full-lotus. The sounds of the blockages breaking open where like gun shots -- and I realized that the light had now cleared out of my head.",
  "I held on like I was clearly riding the wildest trip of my life and at this point the music was my only guide on reality. I kept thinking -- which is first sound or light.",
  "The rainbow of reality kept clearing out even deep body blockages and I realized this is the true Level 4.",
  "At this point the consciousness as complementary opposite was just playing with me so I used my left-brain ego to do reality testing. My ego was clearly just the left brain dominance which would wave in and out of this rainbow of reality -- and while the ego was on the crest of the way I would throw out questions to test the rainbow of reality.",
  "Again -- which is first sound or light? Is Ramana Maharshi correct that the I-thought -- the source of the I-thought is more important than the OM mantra.",
  "The answer I received as so mind blowing -- and body transforming -- that .... well as my body blockages would clear out my mind was clear out some deep memory -- and not just a memory but a connection with the larger pain of reality -- stored in my body.",
  "So when I cracked my head against the corner of the wall -- and it sounded like a gun shot and as more head blockages cleared out sounding like gun shots I was literally dieing. I reality tested this while in full-lotus - the pain would transform to even deeper orgasmic esctasy while I was in full-lotus and the experience of external suffering would get released through the clearing of the body blockages.",
  "The only thing that kept my going was the full-lotus and this is why the rainbow meditation suddenly became so real. Any visions I experienced -- any thoughts that I reality tested -- would get sucked back into the rainbow of reality. I reality tested the highest mountains, the deepest oceans, the coldest cold, the nasiest smells, the nausea of throwing up, the old age, my mom and my dad, genocide -- all sucked into the rainbow of reality.",
  "Then something amazing happened -- as the deep euphoria kicked in after the deepest pain of the blockages clearing out -- the sweat kept coming -- and I was laughing but I realized that I was living through the reality of others -- the mentally retarded, the late-term cancer. Finally I shit myself and this too was a joke -- my mind raced with so many amazing connections and I just wanted the RAINBOW OF REALITY to stop.",
  "But I kept going in the full-lotus and I tried reaching for my glasses twice only to fall back. I even thought maybe if I jerk off it will stop the trip -- but my ego was sucked back into the rainbow of reality before my hand could get there. Finally I threw up -- but I don't remember what happened after I threw up. I collapsed out of full-lotus and kept reality testing the mind-bending rainbow of reality.",
  "The trip was coming down but time and space were a total joke and I just wanted it desperately to end -- my ego had been totally destroyed. I found my mind-body making these amazing sounds that were really deep and straight from my heart -- and this was the sound of the universe as it warps spacetime through the rainbow of reality. I found myself going through the cool down of the full-lotus meditation -- without even thinking about it. I had experienced the rainbows speeding through my energy channels of my body -- I had tasted light -- and now I was rumbing every toe -- I was gyrating in bliss -- I was laughing and the laughing of the trance healing music of the Bushmen was right there with me.",
  "Finally I had the real rainbow meditation and I realized that reality is just this rainbow vortex created by the ohm of the heart as the universe. The universe is pure love and I was just so glad to be back to reality.",
  "My glasses were all bent up and I had thrown up in the bucket or pot -- amazingly. I checked the clock. I had drank the stuff at 2:45 pm and it was now 7:45 pm -- an amazing 5 hour trip.",
  "I was just so glad to be alive and back to reality -- this fake ego trip reality. I knew that the real reality was just so intense and that real yoga samadhi means riding the rainbow of reality as it creates spacetime itself -- through the ohm of the heart-universe.",
  "Words are just a cheap ego trip -- the humility of dying so many times and coming back -- the euphoria of the parasympathetic heart death -- the rainbow of reality -- so many visions of my life -- all connected --- all a rainbow trip."
