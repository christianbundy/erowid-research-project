 "report": "<p>My friend Steve was able to get me four Didrex diet pills, each containing benzphetamine.  I had not done speed before, and was anxious to try it at least once.  He came over early, and all of my friends having an open door policy, came in and woke me up.  He had the four Didrex in his hand, which I gladly paid for.  With that, he was off, poor bastard had to work.  I popped the first pill while I was still in bed, figuring that I might as well start the day off right.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, I found the effects starting to kick in.  I decided to put on some thrash music to facilitate the speeding process.  Within the next thirty minutes, my eyes were huge, and I was sweating bullets, but sitting perfectly still, save for a leg I nervously bounced to keep myself occupied.  While I was online, my friend Lacy wanted to know if I wanted to see her new car.  I decided why not and we ended up riding around town for about two hours. When I got home, I wrote some more on my novel for another hour, and by that time I was starting to crash.  Through sheer willpower, I stayed awake and just as I was bout to nod off, I took the next pill.  In a matter of minutes, I was cranking again, sweating like a pig and talking to my friends online. </p><p>After another two hours of reading, I noticed that the second pill I took didn't quite get me as high, so i cut one of my remaining two pills in half and took one of the halfs.  That did it.  I started talking about life and philosophy with a fury I had not known before.  I was able to have three conversations about the aspects of reality while keeping everything straight.  After an hour and a half, i noticed the effect start to fade agian, so I took the other half the the pill I chopped in two.</p><p>Now, I had not slept in two days prior to taking the benzphetamine, so I was rather sleep deprived already.  I was starting to see colors, and smell the fatigue soaking through my pores.  The experience was great.  I have yet to know exactly what came over me, but now I had turned to talking about the origins of human life over the internet in a rather large chatroom.  After that talk was over, I noticed I had one last pill left, and in the spirit of trying things new, I took that last one.  It was the straw that broke the camels back.  I started twitching, seeing colors, hearing voices, and seeing people out of the corner of my eye, even though I was all alone. I cranked for the rest of the night, stopping once to wash the horrible smell off of me, and again to make a pot of coffee. </p><p>Unfortunately, I doubt I'm going to do it again, I liked it too much, and I'm not willing to risk addiction.  I watched the sun come up for the third time, cracked a brew, and proceeded to write this.  I've never felt quite safe doing this, but in the end I feel I made the right decision to try speed for myself instead of basing my opinions soley on what I've heard about the drug.</p>",
