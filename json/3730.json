  "INTRODUCTION:",
  "4-fluoro alpha-methylphenethylamine, or 4-FMP/4-FA for short is a largely unknown substance. It has the general outline of a stimulant, however the substitution on the 4 position would provide a distinct flavour to the activity. It has been noted that the compound is not toxic like its other like compounds with a halogen on the 4 position. The only other experience I have come accross is listed under REFERENCES. Apparently the compound also has acts on 5-HT receptors, similar to the various MD compounds. Hopefully these notes will shed some light on this obscure compound.",
  "SET: I am anticipating change. The last few weeks have left me longing for something that I cannot yet grasp. I feel so close to a realisation but it seems to constantly elude me. I am looking forward to sharing the experience with a close friend of mine, whom I have become much closer to recently having spent much time with her. This is a new compound, quite excited about its possible activity.",
  "SETTING: With my good friend J. Initially my home, with no one around its quiet and relaxed. We can do anything we please, as long as we don't keep the neighbours up. :) Its a lovely day outside, the sun is shining with scattered clouds. Its not too hot, not too cold. Autumn is creeping up, I can feel it in my bones.",
  "EXPERIENCE:",
  "+0:00",
  "5:45 - Ingestion, takeoff. My trip partner J makes a joke about being afraid for her life, having ingested a compound of which little is known about. The trip begins on a light note... I put on a compilation of chill music. Nothing too hard, nothing too mellow. Somewhere inbetween.",
  "+0:35",
  "6:20 - Conversation is easy, things are going well. +1 noted. A distinct warmth in the body, no jittery sensation, no euphoria(as yet). Music is taking me to lovely places as I notice my concentration begin to slip and my thoughts scatter.",
  "+0:50",
  "6:35 - We decide to go for a walk. Feeling of energy flowing through the body, but without the jittery feeling of only amphetamine. There is a certain clarity developing that is similar to MDMA. Constant comparison to MDMA and amphetamine is present.",
  "+1:15",
  "7:00 - Walking to the park brings on the full effect of the chemical. Distinct euphoria. Different to MDMA as it is more elusive, yet it is not the same euphoria as the one present in amphetamine. Body feels light and heavy at the same time with the warmth and energy still building. There is no desire to walk around or dance. Emotions are present, however boundaries do not break down as easily as they would under MDMA. There is a feeling of wanting to break through to the other side. +2.",
  "+1:45",
  "7:30 - +3 Reached. Many things are discussed with J. I feel present in the moment, emotions are easily rationalised and expressed. I am not afraid to discuss things I otherwise would. The euphoria has a distinct flavour of which I have not experienced before... We are in public and purchase drinks. The experience is quite humourous, nothing that couldn't be handled. I do not feel vulnerable on this material in public. The world is a lovely place, the future is unknown but my mind is clear and I know that the future will be ok.",
  "Smooth sailing with a peaceful mind.",
  "+2:45",
  "8:30 - Still at a +3. J reports that the stimulation is beginning to overwhelm the emotional side. I agree. At this point there is a definite stimulant edge to the experience.",
  "+3:45",
  "9:30 - All we feel now is the amphetamine stimulation. We have a drink, it does little to ease the stimulation. The heart rate is higher then I would like.",
  "+4:45",
  "10:30 - Went out for a drink, beginning to get tired but sleep seems far away. We get home enjoy a few more drinks. Talking and laughing the rest of the night away. My heart is rate is still higher then normal.",
  "+6:15",
  "12:00 - Still at a +2. Stimulation definitely present. Mental clarity for too long. My body is tired, though not physically exhuasted like it would be on MDMA or amphetamine. J and I attempt to go to sleep... no such luck. Mild headache is also present.",
  "+11:15",
  "5:00 - Finally get to sleep. However J cannot sleep at all, getting up in the morning without any rest.",
  "CONCLUSION:",
  "There is a unique flavour to the experience that goes beyond MDMA and amphetmamine. A emotional opening with mental clarity and CNS stimulation. The focus of the experience interchanges between the three over time. Each stage reflecting on the previous and brining a different interpretation to the present moment reality. I thoroughly enjoyed the compound, though the effects a slightly too subtle for it to be abusable in my opinion. I would definetly prefer this compound over MBDB or Amphetamine, however it is not as cosmically opening as MDMA can be. MDMA lets me see the world anew, as if I were a child, with the emotions experienced being profound and cosmic taking on a universal significance. 4-FA opened the world up to calm reflection. I was able to think and talk through my emotions, which where made more apparent and tangible. One day I may repeat, though there is no desire to do so any time soon. :)",
