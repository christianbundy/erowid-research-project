 "report": "<p>I discovered the effects of Tussin accidently after a bronchial infection early winter 2000. I started taking 2 'shots' per night because I realized it made me more relaxed while at the same time seemed to give me more energy. I also felt my thinking was clearer than it had been in years. The only negative side effects I noticed were insomnia and occasional bouts of nausea and vomiting. I also noticed a decrease in my appetite (which I didn't consider a bad thing!) During the 8 months I took Tussin, I rediscovered my faith in traditional Christianity. I mistakenly believed the Tussin was responsible for this new peace of mind. I was wrong.</p><p>Because of other health problems (and because I found myself unable to go more than 2-3  nights without taking Tussin), I went to my family doctor, 'confessed' my Tussin abuse, and was diagnosed as suffering from depression and generalized anxiety disorder. My primary care physician prescribed Paxil which was to relieve the anxiety for which I was 'self-medicating' with the Tussin. After 6 weeks of discontinuing my Tussin use and taking 20-30 mg. of the prescribed Paxil, I found myself in a hospital emergency room, disoriented, confused and convinced I had gone through the ultimate salvation/conversion experience.</p><p>Suddenly all my past fears and hopes were resurfacing, seemingly unbidden. I was convinced I was going to see dead friends and family around every corner. I distrusted everyone around me and felt there were 'signs' from God everywhere I looked. I was admitted to the psychiatric ward of the hospital for 4 days. During this time I was taken off the Paxil and needed to be given a mild sedative in order to sleep. My confusion lessened during those 4 days, but I still was unsure of what was happening to me.</p><p>This was over a week ago. Although I'm still sorting out what happened to me, I am convinced the Tussin played a major role. How much of a role remains to be seen and whether I will ever feel 'normal' again is also a question yet to be answered. I wrote this experience report simply because I want others to be aware that Tussin is far from a benign recreational drug. Wishing you more natural ways of finding Peace!!</p>",
