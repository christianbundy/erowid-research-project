  "Hello, and welcome to 'DramaMIND.' I am a 19 year-old fan of hallucinogenic substances old and new, legal and illegal, deadly and perfectly fine in small doses.  I have tried acid, psilocybe mushrooms, ayahuasca, Salvinorin A, amanita muscaria, and, of course, one of the best hallucinogenic substances in existence, the ever-legendary dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM, for the scientifically dumb). Yet, recently, I was told of another legal substance that would trip me out, Dramamine.  Let my story begin.",
  "My first trip consisted of only nine pills, and was pure Dramamine.  By pure, I mean DRAMAMINE, and not the Wal-Mart generic brand (I will get to that in a minute).  I downed the pills with some Pepsi, and popped in a good movie.  I always watch a movie while I trip.  I find them fascinating while my mind is altered.  This particular movie happened to be one of the more 'you have to watch this on *blank*' movies, ALTERED STATES, and was pretty damn cool anyways. ",
  "Anyway, so I'm there on my bed, enjoying some chips, when the trip starts to begin.  Not too much happened at the beginning, more like a drunk feeling really, or a marijuana stone.  Pretty cool.  Then everything started to come into play.  I remember exclusively looking at the back of the DVD case, and seeing all of the images in 3D.  I thought that totally kicked ass.  As I said, I love to trip OFF ANYTHING.  I focused on the movie, and laid back on my bed, concentrating on the trip.  The movie began to go into the first trip sequence (if you have ever seen Altered States, than you know how fucked up you can get by seeing a seven-eyed goat on a mind-altering hallucinogen).  That honestly scared the hell out of, and I think sent me into a bad trip.  But, then again, I welcome bad trips like Christmas gifts.  The images were emanating from the television, rendered in all three dimensions.  It was absolutely unreal.  The movie continued on in this way, getting trippier and trippier and trippier. ",
  "This was just my first trip on the stuff.  I enjoyed it very much.  I used nine on the first and second trips, yet on the second, I bought the generic version.  I found it to be much easier on my wallet, and much more of a deal.  You see, for five bux at Wally World, I get a bottle of dimenhydrinate tablets in a quantity of 100, instead of (yawn) nine.  Also, I noticed that each tablet contains 50mg of dimenhydrinate instead of only (yawn) 25mg.  More bang for my buck, to put it mildly.",
  "Since, I have moved on to greater doses, and more mind-blowing trips.  My usual dose (to date) is between 15 and 20 tablets, generic.  At these doses, I become completely attuned to the world not around me, I find myself being brought into the circle, when no room for me remains.  I have had devastatingly more intense trips on dimenhydrinate than I have on lysergic acid diathylamide (LSD, again, for the laymen).  Let me elaborate.",
  "My first trip on 23 pills was taken December 18, 2002.  I knew exactly what I was doing, and still know what I am doing to this day.  Furthermore, I take extreme care to rid myself of potentially hazardous surroundings, scenarios, or environments.  I use a trip sitter AT ALL TIMES, and she happens to be trained EMS personnel.  If there is anything to go wrong with a trip, it will and I may not like the effects.  With that note, I will continue.  The trip started out as the first.  I was just like 'Whoa.  Hey, I feel stoned.'  I like the onset.  This particular night, I decided to 'DXM it.'  What I mean is, I decided to trip in total darkness rather than watch a movie or have any light source running.  I was rather anxious and curious about what I would encounter, but this proved to be a contributing factor to the way the trip went.  For most, it would be described not only as a bad trip, but absolutely 'horrible, frightening, and psychologically disturbing.'  Yet, I found it to be rather interesting and, although some aspects were very disturbing, very fulfilling and what a trip should be as far as the visuals and mindset are concerned. As I said before, bad trips are welcomed with open mind.",
  "As the visuals began, I noticed a blue squid cascading across my floor.  This was the very first visual, and the beginning of a very cool trip.  I was sitting on the edge of my bed, looking around my room.  I do have a window, but it made very little difference.  The visuals were full-force.  I fixed my eyes on the silhouette of a Pepsi can sitting in front of my TV, and watched as it sprouted arms and legs, and wielded a battle axe, striking a threatening Mountain Dew can next to it.  At that time, I had a collection of about twenty soda cans piling up on my end table and crowding my TV.  I watched, for about an hour and a half, a very kick ass war being raged amongst the Pepsi, Coke, Mountain Dew, and various other soda cans there on my table.  In the end, a damned generic brand ended up being the victor.  This soda can then lept off of the table, and exploded into nothing, leaving behind a glitter, much like the Death Star exploding.  I watched the glitter fall, and as it settled upon my legs, I noticed myself being swept out of my open window, whilst being perched upon my flying bed, and into my backyard.  I sat in utter disbelief at this visual, because, though I knew it was very unreal, it had seemed just like I was sitting here talking to you now.  My shed was making ominous noises, and the tree in the yard pulled a 'Wizard of Oz,' stating I stole its apples.  Funny thing, though.  It's a maple.",
  "I looked at my open window, closed my eyes, and suddenly I was back in my room.  But it was only in my room for a moment.  I tripped back to work, and imagined I was being promoted.  Snapping out of this, I don't know if I was asleep or awake.  I turned to face the mirror across from me, and began a conversation with my reflection.  Though it was dark, I could see quite well.  My reflection was genuine in every way, yet it mimicked nothing that I did.  Instead, it was completely independent.  I conversed with it in sheer amazement, and then it offered me my hand.  I took hold, and was pulled into the mirror, completely retroversed from the outside world.  I learned many things from myself, and I taught myself many things as well.  He showed me all he had seen, and all that he had lived, and showed me a life truly independent from that of my own.  I was brought to tears by some of the things I had witnessed, for many of the persons important to me were alive and well in this retroworld.  I departed, and found myself back in my room.  I tuned again to my reflection, but instead noticed a cobra, speaking and billowing flame.  I tried to turn away, but I was already there.  I witnessed many things that night in Hell.  Souls were burning, and torment was everywhere.  The demons were abound and happy, yet the souls were in agony and painfully calling to me for help. ",
  "I could do nothing but watch, though I had no desire to help them in the first place.  I am a LaVeyan Satanist and welcomed this aspect of the trip as well.  This lasted for maybe 15 minutes and I was again brought back.  I noticed a battle of my picture frames and model cars.  I watched my guitar turn into something that only Rob Zombie could have inspired, my own body melted into the bed and my pillows tried to devour me. ",
  "This has been my account of the greatest and most welcomed trip that I have ever encountered.  I try almost nightly to recreate the effects, but more often than not, I find myself going through even wierder adventures, though all of them have been rather pleasant, or as most would describe as the 'typical good trip.'",
  "I enjoy dimenhydrinate, and I am sure that certain side effects and health risks will affect me.  But, I am a tripper, yet, perhaps more precise, an explorer.  I love to explore the power of the mind, and I love to expose the subconcious.  I love to ask the question 'What IS reality?'  Are these trips simply an illusion, or are we, by altering our minds with these chemicals, opening up new worlds and exploring new plateaus, and perhaps, entering the coveted fourth dimension?  As long as the question can be asked, I will always be open to ways of trying to answer it.  Much like the character of William Hurt in ALTERED STATES, Dr. Eddie Jessup, I will forever be searching, and forever be in ALTERED STATES.",
