  "<p>This occured during a vacation on Crete. I had brought 1g of Sceletium Tortuosum that I had bought from an online supplier, with me. After a bit drinking on the fourth night, me and my friend P, decided to break out the bag on the beach by the barstreet. We snorted a small pile off my credit-card each. It stung a little on the way, kinda like snuff-tobacco but worse.",
  "We went to the bar where our friends sat and I was really happy, laughing and joking with friends and unknowns. My perception was kinda fuzzy. I guess that the drug did something, but I can't put my finger on it since I was happy anyway(being on Crete isn't like an everyday situation). We proceeded to a couple other bars. I was on top of the world. We hooked up with a pair of girls we knew from our hotel. And we went to some nightclub. I found dancing really fun but much harder than usually. The rhythm wasn't there. Anyway me and P decided we should go to the bathroom and try a larger amount of sceletium to see what happens.",
  "The toiletdoor was broken and couldn't be locked so P had to hold the door while I poured the rest of the bag on top of the toilet. I made two really fat lines and snorted one of them...",
  "PAIN!! I've never felt more intense pain in my whole life than when the stuff hit the inside of my nose! I tried to blink the tears out of my eyes but I couldn't. Then I held the door trying to keep the burning in my head under control while P took his line. I've never seen an expression more painful than the one on his face when he was done..  It was kinda enjoyable though in a twisted, perverted way.",
  "After we stumbled out of the toilet it took about 15 minutes till the pain had subsided a little so I could order a beer without making strange faces. After my beer we went home to the hotel, because P was too confused to be around people he said.",
  "As to the psychoactive qualities, I'm sure they were enjoyable but it's hard to tell..",
  "I'd definately try this again, it was fun. And the pain wasn't that bad.. It was a different type of pain than the normal pain, we call it the divine pain.  I wonder if it is possible to ingest this orally. Next time I'll get the 2X extract and maybe not take that much at one time.</p>"
