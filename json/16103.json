  "[Erowid Warning: Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.]",
  "I had first learned of coricidan from a friend of mine at school. I decided that one day I would get some coricidan cough and cold pills from my local grocery store and take them to school the next day and trip out with my friends. When I got home that night I was really bored and I was getting more and more curious about the effects of coricidan. Finally I gave in to my curiosity and opened up a box and downed 16 pills.",
  "When I first started the trip I was a little scared because the only drugs Ive done before than was marijuana and morphine. As the trip got harder and harder I kept getting a little bit more and more scared. I was very agravated at the fact that I couldnt focus on the t.v. so I just turned it off put in some good techno music and flipped on the black light. Now that I was getting a little bit use to the high I decided to be a little daring and try some things to increase the fun and turned on the strobe light which just ended up throwing me into a deep deep state of confusion to the point where I didnt even know myself or why I was actually feeling that way.",
  "The next day I could still feel some of the effects of the DXM which made me quite happy to tell you the truth. I was a little scared though because I had to drive about half an hour to get to school. I drove up the street about half a mile and decided I couldnt handle the drive so I drove down the road to a good friends house and I had her drive me to school. Once I got to school I took an additional 16 pills and passed out the other 6 boxes I had. Every one I gave the coricidan to freaked out and went home.",
  "After school I had to deal with driving home, and I was at the peak of my high. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]Unfortunately I never made it out of the school parking lot before I got in an accidant because I was talking to my girlfriend in the passenger seat. My girlfriend is very anti-drug and has no idea Im under the influence. Instead of doing the sober thing and pulling over and trading information I decided to run from the scene. I drove up to the next light and my girlfriend started freaking out and made me go back so I did and now I have to pay a thousand dollars in damage.",
  "Days and days go by and I keep ending up with more and more coricidan. I was tripping every day, until I had to go to MEPS (military entrance processing station). I was now officially apart of the U.S. army. After I returned from MEPS I made my first stop at a grocery store to pick up more ccc's.",
  "Weeks went by with continual abuse of the drug my friends noticed a drastic change in my behaviors. The DXM made me extremely bipolar and deeply depressed. I hit a downfall when I decided to have an overnight get together with friends and we would all trip out on triple c's. I dont remeber exactly what happened but when I woke up the next morning I found many people to be mad at me. Eventually I realized I had lost all my friends due to my drug use. I broke down crying begging my friends for help I even confessed to my friends parents, my father, and even the youth pastor at my church. Later that night I went to my first N.A. (narcotics anomonyous) meeting, where I felt a drastic change and knew I would be able to quit without a problem.",
  "The next morning I freaked out about the idea of being sober so in this five minute time period from when I woke up I decided to run away from home. I packed all my stuff into my car and I left. That night I slept in my car behind an old movie theatre downtown. I had a little brush with the cops because they thought I was trying to break in to my car and I was lucky enough that my dad didnt report the car stolen or me missing so I was free to go. The next day I pawned off my guitar amp and my keyboard and spent the rest of the day doing random drugs with a complete stranger. That night I drove for 2 hours to Gainsville where I snuck into my cousins house for the night. That weekend Ill never forget. I went to numerous parties and did so many drugs and mixed so many things that I have no idea how Im alive today. In those couple of days I grew a huge reputation for myself, half the city knew me by name. Monday night I stayed with a new friend at his place where I met his sister and her friend. I introduced the two girls to coricidan which I think they enjoyed as much as myself.",
  "That night in all the confusion I raped the guys sister totally oblivious to what I was actually doing. The next day the police were at his door they took me away in handcuffs and took me to the police station where I was questioned for hours. Then they released me to my mom whom also lived in Gainsville. I continued doing the triple c's. I ran into the girls brother a couple of weeks later, he took me to an abandoned house where we smoked weed for hours and as we were getting ready to leave he kicked my ass till I was passed out and bleeding on the floor. I woke up a little later I was alone in middle of nowhere having to walk home. I now go to Gainsville high school where I ended up becoming popular in a matter of a day or two because of the reputation I had built around my self since coming to Gainsville.",
  "I still continue to do coricidan despite the major damage Ive done to my mind and body. My father has disowned me and is trying everything to ruin my life. I got arrested for trying to steal ccc's from wal-mart. My mind is so fucked up Im to the point where I dont know if Im depressed, happy, or even insane. I keep a journal now just to keep myself from going completely nuts. I tried killing myself by overdosing on DXM I took 78 ccc's but I was fine, it was a hell of a trip though. I didnt feel like killing myself because I was depressed or anything but Im so lost right now I dont know what to do. The army has been searching for me for awhile now. I have like 20 messages on the phone from them. I was suppose to ship out for basic training 2 days ago. Im still in love with DXM but I wont let anyone else touch it if I can help it. I used to be a normal church going kid now look at me. Its fucked up."
