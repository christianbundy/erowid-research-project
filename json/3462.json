  "I've done Coricidin once before, but I was really tired and slept through the peak of my trip.  This time, I was prepared.  Me and two other friends bought a few boxes.  I took 8, one took 9, and the other took 15.  We got on the bus and went to a small studio apartment so we could trip in peace.  When we got there, we decided to smoke some weed so we would have something to do before the Coricidin kicked in.  I got extremely blazed and the intercom rang.  I let them up and the next thing I knew, there were five more people and three cases of beer in this tiny room.  Everyone piled into the bathroom to hotbox.  My friends and I always turn on the hot water to fill the air with steam.  It makes for a quite enjoyable experience. ",
  "The coricid was starting to take effect, and the heat of the steam was making me nauseous, so i went and watched TV as I came up.  When everyone was done, I had to pee.  I went into the smoke/steam filled bathroom and started to feel really strange.  Everything looked like there was red light shining on it.  The feeling was getting more and more intense, and I started to get scared.  I finished peeing as fast as I could and buttoned my pants.  I didn't have time to fasten my belt before I rushed out of the bathroom and passed out on the floor.  I felt like I was floating.  I could hear people talking, 'woah, Sarah passed out', 'is Sarah OK?'.  I could hear everything, but I couldn't move or speak.  I knew that everyone was crouched around me, and I heard them say they were going to move me.  They picked up my limp body and put me in a chair.  I don't know how long I was out for, but it was the most interesting feeling ever. ",
  "Eventually, I came to and felt fine, not normal, of course, I was still tripping hardcore.  At that point, we wanted to get out of the cramped apartment.  We stoped at a convenience store to buy water.  A friend grabbed a bottle and walked towards the front to pay.  It slipped and fell on the ground, and shattered.  Water went everywhere.  It was so strange, because plastic bottles don't shatter.  Yes, Coricidin aided in producing the strangest experiences of my life."
