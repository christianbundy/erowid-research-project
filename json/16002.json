 "report": [
  "To start off I got Tylenol 3 pills containing codeine from my doctor for my broken elbow. Anyways, one night while watching tv my arm was hurting quite bad,so I took three pills, but that didn't really help much, so i took another three pills. It started off slow, first with a slight numbness of my body, then about an hour after I took the pills, I started to really feel it. I couldn't keep my head from falling, then foolishly I decided to get a drink.",
  "As soon as i got up form my chair,I fell to the ground, I tried hard to move my legs but they just wouldn't do anything. I didn't feel sick or anything, just like i was really drunk. I just sat on the floor for about 30 minutes moaning and rolling around. Thinking back i don't remember much after that, I didn't pass out i just had a heavy fog over my brain. I never got myself off the ground, my brother came and picked me up and brought me to my room.",
  "Overall it wasn't a bad trip I've had worse before, BUT, be ready when for the trip when it comes."
