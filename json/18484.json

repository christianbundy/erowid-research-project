 "report": "<p>After smoking pot often and trying other euphoric experiences like ecstacy I was eager to try tripping. I had tried asked around for shrooms or acid in my area, but found myself out of luck unless I wanted to buy blotters or ounces. I researched online some and read about morning glories and hawaiin baby woodrose. The HBWR seeds seemed quite appealing, with many users reporting a 'happy' but not necessarily psychedelic experience 100% of the time. I thought the seeds would be worth a try.</p><p>First I went to a local drug store and bought some Dramamine (nauseau relief) to cure the expected sick feeling when eating HBWR. I took the dramamine dosage a half hour before I ate the seeds. The fun began when I began grinding seeds at about 1:10 pm. After 1 seed being ground to a fine powder, I was too eager to try this new experience so I began chewing them thoroughly. By 2:00 pm I had eaten 11 seeds. Which were all chewed very well to assure that my body would digest them well. After I consumed all my seeds, and my friend with me also at 11, but quicker than I had, we decided to go for a nature walk. Within about 15 minutes we both agreed we felt energetic, and odd, but in a happy way. The feeling had felt like the 'creeping up' period when people take ecstacy, or acid (so I'm told).  After about an hour of eating my seeds I felt disappointed. My friend began to see trails, color changes, and I had still just felt 'creeping up'. So we decided to hang out and watch T.V. over at his house. Over the next hour, which had been up to three hours since consuming, I felt sick, like motion sickness. I took another Dramamine since I only took a half dosage the first time.</p><p>As my sickness and uneasy feeling grew, so did my aggrevation. I found T.V. to be incredibly annoying while my friend found it incredibly intriguing.  As it reached about 3 hours after my consumption time, I began to feel delightful and happy. I would just sit and laugh for minutes on end because of my harmonious feeling. It was quite enjoyable. After we both definetely agreed that HBWR seeds had a 'cool effect', we thought we'd go for a ride. We drove around town running errands. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I began to feel very odd inside my head. Trees and the sun were fun too look at, my perception of size seemed quite distorted during this time also. After walking around in public places we began to notice that people were looking at us very odd. Strange looks were being giving by people outside, driving by, etc. We looked at each others eyes and our pupils had gotten gigantic. I looked like a cartoon character almost. Anyone would have noticed my pupils were far too large for the daytime.</p><p>Anyways, the delightfully odd trip went on for another hour or two. Then my friend began to become very paranoid and freaked out. He had begun to worried that the drug had messed him up for good, he was worried about going into pyschosis, or having a bi-polar disorder. He was worried and wanted to go home, So I went to hang out with some other friends since I was still tripping and didnt want to go home. My new companion for the night and I drove to his house quick so he could change clothes from work. I stayed in his car and chilled. I felt completely disconnected to thought, or from will to think, talk, or do anything really. As I sat in driveway outside, lights began to move around and the size of the driveway was changing frequently, like morphing. My friends car then began to also morph into strange but similar looking shapes. I was still enjoying my trip. Then my friend, who was not tripping, wanted to go out and socialize/party, as would anyone on a saturday night. We went over to a hot chicks house to chill. But as more and more people began to come around me, I felt very awkward. The awkwardness grew as the need progressed, and more people were about me. Conversations with friends were odd, because I couldn't think of anything to say, since I still felt so awkward.</p><p>As the night moved on, now nearly 8 hours from my 11 seeds consumption, I felt worried if this awkward feeling of thoughtlessness and confusion would ever leave. I too thought that I would end up in psychosis like my friend had worried earlier. The night lengthened out as did the awkward feeling. I went home and chilled in my bed, which was then about 12 hours after I had eaten the seeds. I stared at the wall and notice it was melting, and it began to take on vivid colors and morph. I was still trippping. I just decided for myself it would be best if I got sleep and maybe the awkward trip would leave by the next morning. And it did, I felt less awkward in the morning, however everything still looks kinda 'odd'. That concludes my experiences with HBWR. My trip was a trip for myself inside my mind, which helped my contemplate lots of issues in my life. I thought the trip helped a lot, though it was a bit worrysome. :-D</p>",
