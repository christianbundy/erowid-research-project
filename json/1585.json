 "report": [
  "It was my first experience with mushrooms, and my bf's fifth. It was a Sunday night, and we ingested the shrooms at 12pm, in his room. I wasn't at all worried about the trip, as he had mapped it all out for me: we would start to feel the effects at about 12.45, and would probably start our peaking at 1.30am. I felt secure and at ease, and was glad for that. I didn't want to provoke a bad trip due to feelings of nervousness.",
  "0:00 - After we ate 2 grams each, we layed back on his bed and watched TV, waiting for the experience to start.",
  "0:30 - The first signs of the drug are beginning to surface. I notice a slight change in awareness, I feel slightly seperated with the surroundings, the walls in his room.  My bf tells me that in another 15 or so minutes I'll start to feel the drugs more.",
  "0:45 - The patterns begin. These last throughout the entire experience, until finally fading at 7 in the morning. They are tiny patterns which cloud my vision entirely, whether my eyes are open or not. Sometimes they are tiny circles, but most of the time they're lines, boxes, squiggly shapes.. and they are in a rainbow of colors. They remind me of the bright hippy posters from the '60's. My bf doesn't see these shapes yet, and I realize that when i close my eyes, the spirling grows more intense, and I can seemly get lost in the colors and patterns.",
  "0:55 - The room seems to become somewhat eerie. I feel completely removed from everything except from my bf, beside me on the bed. It feels as if we're alone against the room, and my only comfort is him. He feels this 'slight paranoia' as well, stating that he feels 'kind of scared.' I look around the room, and for a slight second i think i see someone standing by the door. The radio, which has been on the entire time, suddenly becomes louder, startling me. It sounded like someone was standing in the room, talking to us. I reasurre myself that my anxiousness is only due to the shrooms, and I calm down. My arms begin to feel very weak, and very heavy.",
  "1:10 - By this time I have totally lost track of my mind. I am having endless revelations about my relationship with my bf, as well as how i see myself. I see myself in the future, tripping on shrooms with another guy, after my current bf, and I wonder if I will ever be in the same place, with someone else, looking back on tonight. The thought scares me. My bf is talking on and on about past experiences with shrooms, as well as other strange topics. I barely pay much attention, as I am too wrapped up in the current going-ons around the room.",
  "2:00 - Everything is chaos. My mouth feels wierd, dry, and it hurts from smiling so much. I don't know what to do with it, and I lick my lips alot. My surroundings seem so changed, and when I stare at one spot for too long, I become seperated from everything, and melt into the bed. I still feel so incredibly weak and clumbsy, when i try touch my face, my hand seems too big and as if it is made of putty.",
  "3:30 - My bf gets up to go to the washroom, leaving me laying on his bed by myself. This is where I realize how messed up I am. I'm laying there, staring at his wall, and I feel so connected to his room. I'm talking to his walls, introducing myself, thanking them for sheltering me all the times I'm over at his house, and trying to make friends with them. One of his walls shakes, and seems to 'look over at me' (at the time, it made perfect sence) and I was thrilled to think his wall and his door were accepting me. I felt so comfortable, so warm, so loved. And then my bf came back from the bathroom.",
  "The trip began to fade slightly after that, and the mind-fuzziness cleared up a bit.  Pretty soon the sun began to come up, and the light made everything feel more 'real.' Although around 5 in the morning, I was completely wierded out by the fact that EVERYTHING in his room was greyish-green, except for one yellow hat on his dresser. He didn't seem to see this however.",
  "6:30 - The patterns are still visible, but much weaker than ever. I still feel disoriented, but to a much less extent. I get up to go to the washroom, and as soon as I do, I suddenly feel extremely hot and I feel like I'm going to be sick. I just run cold water for a minute, splash some on my face and have a drink, and after a moment the feeling passes.",
  "7:00(or so) - I fall asleep, and sleep for about 8 hours. When I wake up, I still feel slightly disoriented (my bf described it as feeling 'hung over' after drinking) and I was sweating all over.",
  "Mushrooms are a crazy trip, nothing like I had expected. My mind comes to so many different realizations, and I honestly believe everything is going to be 'so much different' when I sober up. (Different as in 'better', I believe I'm so insightful). But when the trip is over, the realizations fade as well, although they are definitely worth the experience."
