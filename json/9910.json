 "report": [
  "The experience that my boyfriend and I had on DOC was so AWFUL overall that I feel the need to preface this report by saying that we are not anti-drug crusaders by any means, but, also that I am not making any of this up. Perhaps some of you will laugh at the sheer ridiculousness of this and consider us incredibly stupid ... but I hope that you may be able to avoid such an awful experience! Don't mix this stuff with psych meds!!!",
  "I'm not sure of the dosage, except that each of us took two hits of white blotter paper each of what our friends told us was DOC and that it was a 16-hour trip. Being moderately experienced with LSD and meth myself for a decade now, I figured I could handle this easily. Also, I have been taking antidepressants off and on for about 10 years to combat my bipolar disorder (which I've had since very young, definitely pre-drugs!), and have usually mixed my psych meds with drugs, with either deadening effects (i.e. MDMA, I feel NOTHING, or either very *mild* euphoria) or pleasant, happiness-enhancing effects (i.e. with LSD. Zoloft/Paxil and acid together, for example, meant I never had a bad trip, and everything was just much more colorful!).",
  "My boyfriend had never tripped before, but, since our friends said this was a 'weak' dose, we each took two hits. He takes tegratol, an anti-seizure medication. I take Lamictal, an anti-seizure med/mood stabilizer, which I'd never mixed with psychedelics before. Perhaps this was the random factor in making this the first BAD trip I'd ever had?",
  "We each took two hits at about midnight. I felt the effects immediately. VERY very strong, fractal, colorful visuals, every poster on my wall was 3D and the walls and ceiling were breathing and turning colors. I was enjoying it. BF began shaking all over immediately and became very disoriented and refused to be left alone (not common for him). The visuals kept peaking and peaking. I sat on the porch alone smoking a cigarette, and in the dark, closed my eyes and saw bright, rainbow, almost flaming colored visuals even with my eyes closed, as if tendrils and wrought iron patterns were growing and spiraling. It was very nice, almost peaceful, but with an increasing edginess and uneasiness.",
  "The trip kept peaking, and peaking. I might have enjoyed this if at a festival, in a large open space with NO CARS and lots of people and lots of people to help me calm down and come down. No such luck. Just my BF and I in our apt., both of us too fucked up to drive, and nowhere to go, and, by the time the psychosis hit, too early for any of our friends to come pick us up or come talk us down, or shove the many xanaxes down our throats that we really should have taken.",
  "Around 7 a.m., the psychosis hit full-on. BF initially was even worse than me, going into full-blown panic, making me even worse. I remember sitting in the dark in front of my computer, trying to type, and feeling like I was in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney World, with leering corpses hanging out of the walls and ceiling, surrounding me. It was awful. I had to get outside. I felt like I was in a time loop. I remember it being 5:23 a.m. for hours. Also, my thoughts began looping and growing more and more irrational. I began yelling and repeating myself, just blurting out random numbers and garbage. ('Trigonometry is the answer to everything! 5-21! etc etc). Then I began throwing things and breaking things, with the thought of, 'Do what thou wilt! All I have to do is say the magick words and all my dishes and glasses will magickally repair themselves!' All reason disappeared. Books, candles, went everywhere, one through my window. I went outside, and began throwing flower pots. Then, upon seeing passing cars, I would run up to them, wave them down, knock on their windows and begin hurling slurs or insults at the people inside. I then laid in the middle of the road, thinking, so what if I get hit?",
  "BF began freaking out. Help was nowhere to be found. He called 911 on his cell phone. Stupid? Perhaps. But, if he hadn't, I could have gotten run over or probably had the shit beat out of me by someone in one of these cars that I was flagging down and calling names.",
  "Cops came. I walked up to the cop and called him a pussy, among other names, and asked him for a cigarette. He thought I was being aggressive, so, he pepper sprayed me and handcuffed me. Both of us, me and BF, got to ride in the ambulance to the hospital, where the ER staff strapped me down to a bed for 8 hours after pumping me full of haldol.",
  "About 5 p.m. that day, I woke up and we were released. I was still feeling the drug, and seeing the colors and pulsating light.",
  "The next day around 5 p.m. I had a dystonic reaction, i.e. a SEIZURE, from the haldol, where my jaw locked up and my head rolled back and I couldn't move it. Yay. Found out the hard way I am allergic to haldol.",
  "To top it all off, we ended up with a couple of charges from the snafu and got to go to jail too! (We didn't go the same day, but, turned ourselves in about two weeks later on our lawyer's advice).   ",
  "To sum it up, this one trip is costing us, so far, around $10,000 in legal fees, bail bond and medical bills. I call it DOC for 'Department of Corrections.' Needless to say, I'll never touch this stuff again for as long as I live. In fact, I'm not really in the mood to do any drugs anymore, period. You probably think I'm WITH LE writing this and trying to scare you. I'm not. But, you just need to know, this ain't your parents' happy drug."
