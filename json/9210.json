 "report": "<p>Ok I have been reading alot to see what experiences other people have had on different drugs that I plan to try next time I go home on leave.  I am in the Military, but I believe drugs are only bad if you cant handle them.  </p><p>The last time I was home on leave was the first time I ever used any type of drug.  First it started with driving my friend around to sell drugs to make a few bucks.  One day I watched him and his boys smoke some speed and I really wondered what it would be like but tried to be the good kid like I had always been.  That night my curiosity finally got the best of me and I arranged for my friend to get an 8-ball.  We rented a motel-6 and my friend, a girl who liked to smoke, and me hit it up with the 8-ball.  After a lot of anticipation my friend finally melted a piece of the rock in a pipe and I took my first hit.  I have to admit I was kind of clumsy when it came to rolling the pipe back and forth to melt the rock so my friend would roll it for me while I held the lighter.  As soon as I took about 2 hits I just started jumping up beds and chairs and whatever I could find.  I stated to my friends that it felt like a orgasm going through my whole body.  It was the best feeling of my life.</p><p>Now here is the an important point.  Always always have a real friend (and an experienced one if possible) there with you.  As soon as we finished off the rock I wanted more right then and there.  This was 3:00 in the morning.  My friend was like hold up dawg, first of all there arent any dealers up this time of morning willing to come to a motel six.  I was like well I will go to them then, and I was all ready to get in my car and go but my friend talked me out of it explaing that it would be alot easier to get caught by the cops this time of morning especially as hyped up as I was.  At the time I was kind of annoyed but by the next morning I had come down and was so glad I hadnt done anything stupid.  </p><p>The rest of that morning was spent awake, talking and watching TV.  I was home on 30 days of leave and about 21 of those days was spent on a speed rush.  That was all I thought about.  One night I was toking with my friends in his garage just letting my mind run wild.  I never knew I had any type of artistic ability but that night I couldnt stop doodling in a notebook I found.  Just drawings of nothing and everything.  That is when I came up with TOL Tokin On Leave.  This is basicly my cliq of one where I am at my most opened mindeness.  </p><p>All I can say is drugs may be illegal, but to me I feel I am responsible enough to handle drugs and have a good time and leave it at that.  Also it may be a good thing to take a break to break the cycle.  I had to go back to the military and the first month or so the urge to get drugs was high but I knew I couldnt.  After about a month it didnt bother me anymore.  But now that I have another 30 days coming up I am looking forward to doing speed, x, and shrooms.</p>"
