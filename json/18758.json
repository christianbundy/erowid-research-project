 "report": "<p>So I have been reading about these deadly but thrilling flowers for about six months now and have been unsure of whether to try them or not.  As it turns out, my girlfriend has an angel trumpet tree in her backyard!  I compared the actual plant to pictures that were on the web, did some other research to convince myself that they were the real deal.  Sure enough, at least once a month about sixty long, droopy, pinkish/orange flowers that look absolutely delicious sprout and beg to be picked!  I got two friends in on the adventure with me.  Since there are more horror stories than pleasant experiences, I decided to take only four flowers (one for each of us, and an extra one just in case) and put two and a half of them in a pot (we pussed out a little bit) that I put a liter and a half of water (used a liter container to measure).  They boiled for five minutes, then I squeezed all juice out of the flowers, measured out three equal glasses, none of them containing more than 350ml of liquid. </p><p>After adding a little sugar, it wasn't that bad, it really tasted like an overly fragrant tea...so I added some real tea just to diguise the color of the mixture which surprised almost as much as the trip...it was neon green!.</p><p>Ten minutes after drinking the tea, I felt like I was dizzy and drunk...my friends and I all got extremely tired within the first half hour.  I kept myself alert lest I not wake up from that nap.  My mouth was very very dry, all I could think about that first hour was getting something to drink.  I left my friends, who didn't seem to be tripping much besides their large, dialated pupils, to go take a shower, we were going to hit up a few parties. Before I left though we chopped up some of the remaining flower, mixed it with some dank and smoked two bowls between the three of us.  My friends live just around the corner so I walked home, I remember not feeling very sturdy, just stumbling around like a drunk.  I went home, took a long shower, the effects started to hit me upon getting out of the bathroom.  The strange thing about the trip I get from an angel trumpet is that I never see it coming unless I get the 'breathing' effect right away.  That didn't happen to me, so when I didn't recognize myself in my mirror, I didn't automatically attribute it to the tea...I was high but didn't know it.  Whatever happened to me I thought was 100 percent real. </p><p>I was getting dressed in front of my mirror and after I got my shirt over my head I looked back into the mirror, the reflection didn't have a shirt on.  I began talking to it, I think I asked 'who are you' but he never said anything back...I decided to hurry up and get back to my friends just in case they were bugging out as much as I was.  Speaking of bugging out, my eyes shook uncontrollably a few time, kinda like being on E.  When I got to my friends they didn't have any stories for me, but looked very crazy in my eyes, I thought for sure they were tripping too.  We decided to go to the mall, and I went around their place looking for some sandals I left there. (turns out they were never really there) After ten minutes of looking, one friend saw me with a pen in my hand, I was saying 'ok, let's go, I got them!'  the other friend came up to me and said 'that's a pen, not sandals'  I was very confused by this comment because I thought for sure what was in my had was what I was looking for all along! </p><p>I went into the bathroom to pee, locked the door behind me, but when I looked up, one of my friends was watching me piss, I got mad, yelled for him to get out...then I looked back at the sink and the other friend was washing his hands, but this time I wasn't mad, I had a short conversation with him, finished pissing, looked up and he was gone.  As soon as I went out of the bathroom my friends asked me who I was talking to, I told them there was no way they were going to convince me that it wasn't really them trying to trick me...but the door had been locked the whole time, I imagined them completely! Still stumbling, we piled into the car and headed for the mall.  From the minute we left in the car I had my house keys in my hand.  Thats where they stayed as I walked into the mall, but went into my pocket after one friend caught me trying to stick my key in an xbox conroller..I was saying 'I can't figure out how to get this thing started, is this right??'  they made me put my keys away, probably a good idea. </p><p>We were in a music store, other two friends were browsing through cds, but I kept getting separated from them, or so I thought.  I'd turn around and they wouldn't be there, so I'd walk out of the store and into the mall isles looking for them, then I'd give up, go back inside to where I was standing before I left, and my friends were there all along.  My friends started to feel more trippy, so we thought it would be best if we left the mall.  On the way home, I was convinced that I was driving my own car home, with my friends in the back...I looked up and saw brake lights from other stopping cars and flipped out, franticly searching for the brake pedal with my foot, feeling for the steering wheel and instrument panel with my hands on the dash yelling 'oh my god, my brakes, they don't work, pull over, pull over!' They calmed me down and I realized not only was I not in my own car, but I was sitting in the passenger seat.  That freaked me out. </p><p>The rest of the night I just accepted everything that happened, whether a hallucination or not, I would've talked to you.  I smoked all of my cigarettes before we ever left for the mall, but for some odd reason left the empty pack in my pocket.  Throughout the night I would pull that pack out of my pocket, pick out a cigarette, light it, and smoke it, only to discover on the next drag that I never had a cigarette in the first place...my hand would be shaped like it was holding a cigarette though.  I must've done that about twenty times.  Once I got home, I stripped to my boxers, dove in bed, and was ready for sleep. About twenty minutes later, I'd realize that I was sitting in my desk chair, fully clothed, smoking an imaginary cigarette.  This happened two more times before I decided to keep my eyes open and naturally drift off to sleep.  Above me, shadows of human figures leapt from one side of the ceiling to the other...it didn't bother me, I thought it was beautiful, like they were dancing.  In the corners of my bedroom I'd see a shadow head pop out, as if it were checking to see what I was doing.  That didn't bother me either. </p><p>My cat kept pouncing on my stomach and digging to get under the covers, this got me really pissed because I was trying to relax, so I went to kick her out, I had her by the scruff of her neck, but when I opened the door, I realized my hand was empty and I had locked her out of my room before I ever got ready for bed!!  I only woke up two more times after that, each time I saw my girlfriend on the other side of the bed, and I touched her hair the first time, blinked and she was gone.  The second time I woke up on the edge of the bed, mad because she wasn't giving me any room so I yelled out 'god damnit quit hogging the bed, I'm on the fucking edge, I'm gonna fall off, wake up!' then I realized she too wasn't there.  I got a glass of water, drank it all and finally fell asleep.  The only side effect I experienced was blurry vision...it's been over 24 hours and it's still somewhat hard to read any kind of print...the computer screen is still trying to decide between fuzzy and clear.  My pupils are still dilated, hopefully that'll be fixed by morning. </p><p>Like I said before, the most amazing part of this kind of trip is that you don't believe you are tripping, everything seems like it's behaving as it should, no matter how many beings leap across your ceiling...while all of this was going on, I remember thinking to myself that the tea didn't even work!! Can you believe that?!  I would strongly recommend trying these out, but be very careful...don't drink more than a coke can's worth of the liquid, and don't use more than two whole flowers per person, especially if you're skinny like me, 130 lbs.  It's not that the trip takes a long time to come on, it's that it takes you forever to realize your tripping, if you ever do that is.</p>",
