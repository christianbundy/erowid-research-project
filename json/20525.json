 "report": [
  "I took out the bong with pre-loaded salvia, sat down in front of my TV against a make-shift padded wall made out of pillows and such resting against some old speakers. I took the bong hit of salvia and put my bong down to my right. Still holding onto it I thought, as I always do, When does this shit start working.",
  "Suddenly I was gone. I was shot, pulled, ripped, torn in all directions, reality fell all around me, like cheesy fake walls to some stupid fake reality set/faade, a cruel joke someone/something is playing on us. Blackness and black patterns enveloped me. I was in salvia space, I remember having the distinct feeling like I wasnt welcome there yet, like I had come too far 'in' this time, and I subconsciously tried to get out and had no control over it, like I was being kicked out! My identity/ego tried to come back as different things, like looking from the perspective of objects and parts of my own body (odd). I was the ground I was sitting on, I was the pillow I was leaning against, I became the bong I was holding, then I and all of my awareness/consciousness was centered on and in my right hand, I felt as though I was shot into my right hand and was able to look at all the little workers that made my right hand function. The workers were not entities or divine spirits of any sort, they were just, things, working.",
  "I was flung through somewhere and landed on their level, in their reality. It looked as if I were in some sort of control room or busy office space (confusing), inside or far far away from my own body. A strong sense of family connection overwhelmed me at this time, connections felt towards these workers. The connections dissolved and I felt I had caught a glimpse of something perhaps I wasnt meant to see, I thought, My right hand and everything I think to be real and mine and sane is run by forces out of my control!!!! A sharp jolt and I was looking through my own familiar eyes again with some interesting reality creases, I looked down at my right hand, there was no bong, just a rather large water spill, I panicked for a moment thinking Im still not right then checked behind the speakers where I normally keep it, to my surprise I pulled it out a little less full then before. I have no idea how it got behind the speakers.",
  "Note: I had been smoking pretty potent weed with friends all day that day and I had also dosed an xtc pill and been rolling since about 1:45p.m. earlier that same day. I smoked the salvia at 12:40am."
