 "report": "<p>Ok.  I'm writing this to hopefully clear some things up.  I am currently on intensive probation.  I am regularly tested three to four times a week.  I used robotussin long acting cold gels at least twice a week during my first month of being in the program.  I used it on Friday nights and then again on Saturday nights, so I don't believe there could've been an accumulative affect.  I came up positive three times for opiates and never for PCP.  This was only when it was done at dosages around 600 mg and sometimes over and when immediately tested for right after the effects wore off, or in one case when they were fading.  I have been tested when only using 300 mg and came up negative, this was about 5 hours after the initial consumption.  I was once hospitalized (not for OD'ing, but because juvenile detentions don't have drunk tanks) and barely came up positive for opiates and not for PCP, the dosage at that point was around 1300 mgs.</p>"
