  "So, the amount I had taken was actually accidental. At first I thought I had taken some mislabeled 5-meo-dmt which is inactive orally, so I took another hearty dose of miprocin (4-HO-MiPT), but I later found out that it indeed was miprocin, not 5-meo-dmt. After two hours of no effects (which is very strange because normally miprocin takes only about 20 minutes to kick in) I took a third dose. I still to this day have no idea why the effects took so long to take hold, and honestly I can't come up with a rational explanation for it. In the past month I had taken it maybe two or three times but I had waited about 5 days, so I thought I was clear for a trip. Apparently not, but anyways when it kicked in it REALLY kicked in!",
  "Anyways things began floating as they always did, but they soon became very very different. They were like CGI, and totally unlike previous visuals on other psychedelics I've tried. Things such as mushrooms or phenethylamine stuffs like peyote, are organic and feel constantly repeating. If you blink at a hallucination or visual distortion, everything goes back to normal and retwists itself all over again. But with this high dose of miprocin i could not make them go away.",
  "I looked at the carpet and it turned into a seabed of light diffracting starfish with a multicolored green lustre comparable to opal. They started crawling up the walls and I started sweating a lot, and I closed my eyes hard and I opened them in hopes of calming shit the fuck down but nothing deterred them, and the starfish began to rise to my ankles, over my skin, melting into the carpet... and I had to watch it, all too overwhelming and all too beautiful. Anyways I started screaming for my dad as the starfish began growing fungus-like iridescent beads of orange light, passing them around in circles as I looked outside to the window and the pine trees turned into fractals, resembling this natural fractal produced by the Romanesco broccoli or perhaps a Mandelbrot or Julia set. Also I have a poster of Van Gogh's The Starry Night hung on my wall, and when I looked at it each brushstroke dismantled itself, each one turning into a throbbing, fluttering insectoid being, all of them separating and drifting and spreading all over my wall. Well it was lush and the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life yet I was probably so scared because I didn't expect it or want it.",
  "Overall the hallucinations lasted for a good 16-ish hours and I felt lethargic and mopey for the rest of that day and all that night. During the trip I overheated, blacked out for about 2 hours, woke up with clothing thrown around everywhere and when I saw myself in the mirror I was drenched in so much sweat that my hair looked like it was still drying off from a shower or something. One thing I remember doing before completely blacking out was running like an autistic child up and down my hallway, clad only in boxer shorts and a fuzzy Sun-god blanket, looking at my bed to see my wheelie computer chair placed directly upright on the mattress, laughing maniacally at it, and then dancing around it like some sort of Inca tribesman!",
  "Also I remember looking at art and seeing it dismantle itself into whirring fibres, slithering like a handful of Medusa hair, right in my palms! Also faces were distorted, black and crimson material began to pour from my father's head, my sister's face grew cat-like features, and when I looked at my Hunky Dory vinyl cover, Bowie's face became gaunt, started directly into my eyes, his cheekbones sunk in and the image developed this organic, ever-flowing chiaroscuro-like silhouettes that looked like branches growing in time-lapse.",
  "On the low-side, I also became delirious and was legitimately convinced I had experienced heart failure or a lethal hemorrhage and died after I awoke from the blackout, and whole-heartedly believed I was experiencing a transition into the afterlife and that I was a ghost or floating spirit inhabiting my home (I even tried to find my dead body). I went beyond the feeling of ego death; I went like into a physical and spiritual death!",
  "So yeah that is my trip, and also, I wrote down notes during the trip itself. As well I drew art while under the influence of this powerful compound.</p>"
