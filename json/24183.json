 "report": "<p>Don't consider myself an 'addictive personality,' however, the 'Spirit' of Crystal Meth struck me immediately -- because very soon after taking my first sniff. I recall realizing that I totally wanted some more!  The stuff has a way of making me think I need to do some more. and then some more.  In contrast to LSD, for example, whenever I was having a great trip, I had never experienced any unreasonable or motivating impulse to do more acid!</p><p>For me, fortunately, my life generally set limits on my financial ability to go off any deep ends, and for a number of years (seven, since I began) I managed to keep my consumption in check.  One primary reason, is that I always thought, 'damn if I am going to pay for stuff & use it during an eight-hour-day, and work my tail off for no extra money!'  Towards the end, however, the Spirit grew stronger than my willingness to resist, and I spent a good year in excess consumption.  What a waste.  Although I liked it a lot.</p><p>I view ANY substance as having a 'spirit' of it's own - for me, meth was patient and patient, and snuck up on me and won over me, eventually.  On the other hand, three years since having touched the stuff, I find myself left without any trace of any creative 'oomph,' which thought I always had thru my life -- which had been, extraordinarily, enjoyably, enhanced, by crystal meth.  My reason for 'using.'  A friend said, 'hey! you gotta meet this girl -- she actually does things -- instead of just sitting around and picking on her face.'</p><p>I enjoyed meth because I love doing things, making things, building things, painting things -- crystal enabled me to increase my output/enjoyment to an extreme.  Whatever 'artist' I had within me, I was motivated to really be!  A whole lot!</p><p>Since I've quit -- I've been staggeringly depressed, either as a result of quitting cold-turkey, or because thru the past three years, four members of my beloved family died, I was evicted, I left my successful self-employment to care for my elderly mom, until she, too, passed away..</p><p>None of all of that was necessarily a result of my using -- however, intellectually, reflectively, so many questions arise, especially because it had grown so important to me, on a daily basis.</p><p>Primarily, I find no desire to do much of ANYTHING, anymore.  After all -- none of anything in my life has added up to much of anything -- whatever I did.  There are many more life-realizations that I won't go into -- suffice it to say, that I cannot entirely attribute recent downturn of live events as effects of any 'use.'</p><p>On the other hand, could my use have destroyed my initiative and/or creativity?  Life itself can do that, just as well.  I'm 50 years old -- I don't generally feel as 'enthusiastic' as I once did. Especially, having recently realized so many disappointments and disillusionments.</p><p>So, lately, having nothing but time on my hands to reflect, realizing that I would take up my use again, without hesitation, if I could find any -- it also seems 'rational' to me that at 50 yrs old, maybe I would rather live a shorter, more 'productive' life, than spending any remaining years as an unenergetic 'lump' of aging flesh.</p><p>So, there's the rub.  To be, or not to be, as long as I might otherwise be able to.</p><p>Sooner or later, my demise shall arrive.  I am still healthy, but having spent the past three years as a clean, uninspired 'couch potato,' doesn't seem to hold any long term satisfaction -- compared to shortening my time of life and 'using,' however feeling more satisfied and 'motivated' to create 'output.!'  I could just 'hang in there,' avoiding unhealthy indulgences, bored to tears as I watch my body deteriorate with age or live a shorter time, more enjoyably and energetically and productively. 'Painting' or 'creating' something until my last moment. </p><p>I've read other messages, telling of good reasons not to use -- all good advice -- but I'll bet most of those messages were written by folks 20 to 30 years younger than I am -- I am not looking forward to striving to live thru the next 20 years, growing old and feeble and pathetic and incontinent, etc. etc.  My Dad died at the age of 60.  I will always remember him as full of life, still.  My mother died at age 77 -- in pain and discomfort, for many years, having lived long enough to have surrendered her dignity and self reliance.  My older brother died at 47 years old -- always watching his health -- having everything to live for -- postponing his retirement/enjoyment of life -- losing his dreams prematurely.  I am now older that my older brother.  All in all, the lesson I see, here, is to do what makes me happy!  Every day!  For as long as  I am able.</p><p>Crystal meth was something I enjoyed doing, for a while, that 'enhanced' my enjoyment of life.  In reflection, I was lucky that my 'using' did not bring me down.  Recognizing the strength of its 'spirit,' but it is some thing that I wish I could do, again. </p><p>Basically, I wish I could get my hands on some stuff.  I've had a wonderful life -- I've been lucky to have been able to have done most of everything I ever wanted to do (before I ever met crystal Meth!). If I were told that I were going to die, soon, truly, I could live with that. </p><p>What is causing me concern is the idea of living on and on, for the next twenty years or so, with 'luck,' as my health and my body deteriorates.</p><p>People facing imminent demise can 'travel the world,' or whatever, before their time comes.  For me, after working 40-hour/weeks for the past thirty years -- only to achieve becoming 50 years old -- and unappreciated, my dream would be to live out my time (feeling like I had the motivation to) go & paint something, build something, create something, do something, the way crystal Meth  just made me feel like doing. the way I can't manage to get myself up to feel, lately.</p><p>I don't feel like doing much of anything, these days.  Can't tell if it's because I 'overdid' a bit in the past, or if it's only natural to feel less energetic at this age.  All things considered, I wish I could manage to obtain any kind of pharmaceutical 'assistance,' -- especially in view of children's being prescribed stimulants -- as though that were a good thing to do. </p><p>Here am I, a rational, very adult, intelligent human -- able to legally purchase liquor or cigarettes or excessive food -- all detrimental to health -- but unable to legally obtain a bit of something that I would prefer.</p><p>Whatta heck-uv-a world! </p><p>Ya know, re-reading all that I have just written -- realizing that I've spent over an hour to tell the world at large all about what crystal meth meant to me -- expecially considering that I haven't touched the stuff in over three years -- tells me something about its extraordinary effect upon me -- upon my life -- upon even my thoughts -- 3 years later.!</p>",
