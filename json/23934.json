 "report": "<p>A few weeks ago I was given the opportunity to try AMT.  I'd been told that it was a social drug and that I should make sure to have some friends around to talk to, I was a little bit stupid and didn't, but I live in the dorms at a fairly large university so I knew that if I needed to I would be able to find people. </p><p>I dissolved 35 mg in water and drank it around noon and went out into a meadow near my dorm.  After wandering around for about an hour I began to notice some speedy effects but oddly enough I felt tired so I came back to my room, put on some music (Belle & Sebastian has never sounded so incredibly good) and talked to a few friends from back home on AIM. </p><p>2 Hours in there was a distinct feeling that something was 'off' with the world, it felt somewhat like the come up of mushrooms but with the speedy and somewhat empathogenic effects lending a bit of an ecstasy feeling. </p><p>The main difference between AMT and these two drugs though was the amazing lucidity.  I wanted to avoid too much contact with strange people because I was unfamiliar with the drug but I honestly could have carried on perfectly normal (if a bit sped up) conversations with just about anyone at the time and indeed I did. About 3 hours in I went up to a friend's room and started talking to him, but he had to go to work so I walked to work with him and then back on my own, this was quite nice because the path was throught the woods so I had the opportunity to experience both what the drug does when people are around (it caused the same warm, talkative happy feeling that x does) and what it was like to be alone with my thoughts in the woods (like low doses of mushrooms but with a speedy edge).</p><p>Basically I spent the next 6 hours alternating between these two states, talking with friends or chilling in the woods tripping out on stuff, all with a lucidity that amazed me at the time because I'm used to drugs causing a marked loss of communication skills. </p><p>About 9 hours after ingestion I started coming down and, whereas most other comedowns I've experienced have been somewhat unpleasant like I was losing something, I felt great all through this one.  12 hours after ingestion I went with some friends to see Rocky Horror and when the movie was over I was still in the comedown stage, I ate a pot cookie after the show which didn't really change the feeling much but probably extended it a little and fell asleep an hour or so later.</p><p>The next day I was extremely hung over, I had drank a fair amount of water but apparently not enough, the hangover sucked but I felt it was worth it.  Oddly enough the day after the hangover it almost seemed like I was back in the comeup or comedown from the drug, the whole day was just fantastic, this might not have had anything to do with the AMT but it seemed connected to me. </p><p>I will definitely do this again, this experience was basically what I thought x would be before I tried it.  The only recommendations I can give are drink lots of water and don't redose if it doesn't hit you immediately, it will take a good hour or two before you feel anything but don't worry you're in for a good 6-10 hour peak and adding to your initial dose could cause problems.</p>",
