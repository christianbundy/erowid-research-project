  "The Salvia never left; the point where I begin to feel as though its presence is leaving is marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT.  I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.",
  "This trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.",
  "Unimaginably intense.",
  "The trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna."
