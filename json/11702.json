 "report": [
  "I got a hold of some liquid K, heated it and had pure crystals.  NOTE: if you heat it to get powder, be careful, it has a very distinct odor.  I took approx 400 mg, way more than I intended.  I snorted it at 1:00 AM.  I was barely able to make it back to my bed, I felt really disoriented and knew I had to lie down.  I lost total touch of time, had a horrible trip where I thought I lost touch with reality forever.  Like if a webpage was how we view life, all 5 senses and whatnot, I was stuck looking at html, the raw code, I kept seeing my brain in a kind of dank wet cavern.",
  "Then I would come back into the real world (my bed late at night I mean) and I realized I was covered in vomit, and was almost constantly spitting something up.  It was all over my bed, my pillow, the floor, and me.  I tried sitting up but I fell back into the bed, onto something wet.  At around 5:30 am, I was able to stand, but barely, I staggered all over, and ran into several walls, my desk, my dresser, etc.  I attempted to clean up the puke off the floor, tore the comforter off my bed.",
  "I had to stay home sick that day, could hardly walk straight at 7 am.  I tried to drink some water, and before I put the glass down I was barfing again.  About three hours later I tried again to eat something but was unsuccessful, more puking.  Around noon I was able to keep water down.  All in all, its sad, this was my first experience with k, I was actually looking forward to it, but I took too much and ruined any and all experiences with the drug.  I am sure its much different in mild doses but be careful!",
  "When dealing with pure K, there isn't a big difference between too little and too much.  I have decided not to try it again, as now even the sight of the stuff makes me sick.  Have fun and be careful!"
