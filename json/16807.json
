 "report": "<p>I awoke yesterday, august 13th, 2002, not knowing what was going to happen.  I was with my girlfriend that day, doing some serious thinking about our relationship.  I decided it was time for an end, as we were both going to away to college.  I regrettably ended our relationship at probably around noon or 1pm.  As soon as she left I felt horrible.  I started to cut parts of my body to try to create pain.</p><p>I decided I needed to escape.</p><p>I went and picked up my friend.  We went and gathered a bunch of mushrooms from our colony.  Probably about 20 grams of dry shrooms, and over 10 or so grams of fresh ones.  I drove to my friend Mikes house (nobody was home), and began to eat the fresh shrooms.  It was probably around 4:40pm or so. Nothing was in my stomach for around 24 hours, I weigh 140lbs, and I have a high metabolism.  I dipped them in ranch dressing (I cant stand the fucking taste), and in about 15 minutes I felt the nausea begin.  (I have eaten shrooms before, but I barely tripped).  I knew from my previous experience that once the nausea began, I would trip pretty soon.  About 20 minutes later, I was still outside, and the grass began to have a wavy, ocean effect.  The tree had odd looking vines on it.  I went inside my friends house and sat on the couch.  I had the feeling of my body tensing up.  Suddenly, for a split second, one side of the room seemed to move away from me.  I moved to another couch, and that is when my girlfriend called.  She called my cell phone many times, but I didnt answer it.  I went into my friends bathroom, took a piss, and stared at myself in the mirror for about 5 minutes, because my reflection looked odd.</p><p>I went outside, called my girlfriend, told her I loved her a lot, started to feel bad, and drove home.  At this point I thought the trip was nearing its end (like the last time I tripped), and I just had a buzzed/stoned feeling.  I drove home (it must have been around 5:50pm according to my cell phonethere was some traffic also) and hoped to sleep it off. yeah right.  Once I got inside, (my mom was home) I went into my room and lay in bed.  I crawled under the covers and tried to shut my eyes.  I had a gassy/cramped feeling in my body and I started to get anxious.  I  began to see different green and light green visions (from what I remember).  I was getting a little freaked out because there was a constant sound of crickets at this pointthere are no crickets at this time of day.  My mom said she was going somewhere, I said OK, and shut my eyes again. </p><p>Suddenly the air conditioner came on, which created a vibrating, echoing noise.  I thought I heard some sort of odd thoughts in my head (similar to schizophrenia), and I just wanted the cricket noise to stop.  I said something out loud, and realized it had a echo or reverb effect to it.  I opened my eyes and I began to make noises with my mouth, because I was very interested in these noises.  I shut my eyes and odd, clear, tube-shaped rabbit looking creatures were there.  I watched them for a while.  This frightened me eventually and I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling.  The ceiling suddenly became a perfect pattern of Aztec-looking designs, all squared off evenly, with a mix of colors in their lines.  Every vision I saw at this point seemed to be even, blocked, shapes.  I then looked at my starry starry night painting, which morphed into one blue texture with the wall.  Throughout this whole time I was very schizophrenic, and agitated. </p><p>After this, it seemed to somehow be much later in the day, and my lamp began to bend and melt with a cushion.  I had become fed up with these visions, and took my wobble body into my basement.  There I tried to play my bass guitar (unplugged), and my trip seemed to be over.  I just seemed to be in a state of drunkenness.  After I was unable to play anymore, I eventually went back upstairs and sat on my bed.  I called my friend again (whose house I left earlier), and asked what he was doing.  I was about to go there again when I suddenly found my watch that I had disassembled earlier that week (just the band from one part of it).  I remember it seemed like I spent an hour trying to get that watch band back on, I couldnt do it, but I couldnt stop trying to get it to work. </p><p>Later, once again thinking the trip was over, I called my girlfriend, and asked her to come over.  We were sitting on my couch and her face began to turn green.  I was in the state of feeling like I was born again.  I told her I was tripping and she was about to leave.  Suddenly, when she was at the door, my face turned pale, I broke into a cold sweat, got dizzy, and ran into the bathroom.  I puked up about 4 or so shrooms.  I looked in the mirror and my eyes were DILATED like a mother fucker.  I sat against the bathroom wall to recover, shut my eyes, and saw sparkling, swimming, three dimensional green beads, flowing like water.  As I was talking to her, every time I shut my eyes I saw something different.  A paint brush and palette, various pictures, all very vivid and realistic.</p><p>She took me upstairs, and this is when the REAL tripping started.</p><p>She sat next to me, telling me how she thought about me all day, and all the good things about me.  I was finally in a better mood than before, and my visions were no longer frightening.  I was laying down, listening to her, and my eyes were shut.  I saw geometrical patterns of various metallic objects, usually glistening with a rainbow shine across them.  Shapes, eagles, and Indian, and other interesting things, all aligned perfectly geometrically, all shining with wonderful color.  I opened my eyes and looked at my little red light on my stereo.  I put my hand in front of my eye to cover it up, and my hand became transparent.  I could still see the light and its glow.</p><p>At this point, I was only seeing major visions while my eyes were shut, but they were very interesting.  I then began to think, instead of just sit and imagine images.  I had thoughts only of realization.  I saw myself as being an intelligent, grown person.  I felt I had realized how much I have grown, and thought of some of the things I thought as being very wrongsuch as leaving my girlfriend.  Listening to her, I had realized that she is a very wonderful person, and cared for me even when I was tripping (something she was against), and even while I was broken up with her.  About an hour or so later, the major tripping stopped. </p><p>When I shut my eyes I saw blackness, but sometimes a random image would appear.  When I laid next to and hugged my girlfriend, I shut my eyes and saw a forest, and then a group of vivid flowers.  I laid back down on my side, and shut my eyes.  I felt buzzed and realized I should get some food and water in my body, seeing how I did not eat or drink much, and threw up as well.</p><p>Today is August 14th and I have reconciled with my girlfriend.</p><p>If I hadnt tripped, would I still be with her?</p>",
