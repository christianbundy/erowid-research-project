  "<p>I had never heard of '4-aces' until a few days before taking it.  A friend was on some and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying it, so I decided to try out this new psychadelic at our Halloween party, as did a few others as well.  Of the three of us who took it that night I probably had the most intense and worthwhile experience with the substance.  In fact, it had to be the most intense drug-induced experience of my life!",
  "I ingested a 30mg gel cap at about 9pm, without any prior expectations of what I was getting into.  (Throughout the evening I also consumed a moderate amount of alcohol and marijuana)  About an hour later, our costumed guests started arriving and the drug slowly kicked in.  The whole experience began with slight tremors and an intensified visual field, much like my own experiences with psilocybins, but soon took me in an extremly different direction. ",
  "Before I knew it I found myself interpreting the events and characters of the evening on multiple levels of symbolic meaning.  The costumes around me began reflecting existential and allegorical insights into life (both my own and life in general).  I was swept from room to room, to the porch and yard, confronted by conversations and situations that cut through all the mundanity of everyday life.  Each moment was a scene of such startling clarity that I felt caught up in a play.  And to make the whole experience that much more bizarre I felt that I was writing the play at the same time. ",
  "The last sentence needs more explication.  The next day I received similair reports from the others who had taken the drug that while on it *all events that were about to happen were evident to the observer (on 4-aces)*  This feeling was unlike the deja vu feeling of having experienced the events before, and I could only describe it by saying that I could see the wave front collapsing before me.  It was as if  I could read the script for events right before they occured. ",
  "Of course, the one down side to being so caught up in each moment on this drug was that afterwards all I could specifically remember from the whole experience was individual scenes that had grasped me as being inherently meaningful.  None of the conversations I had left any concrete ideas in my head, nor did I feel upon waking the next day that any of the night before had actually happened in reality.  It was as if the whole experience had taken place in another universe that had intersected with this one.",
  "To be honest, I think that most of the intensity of the experience was related to the fact that it was at a Halloween party, which allowed my mind to create more meaning out of the events of the evening.  Likewise with any visual hallucinations I might have had, everything I saw was intensified, but was present in reality.  So though at one moment I had found myself confronted by interplanetary beings (mostly faeries), they were just my roommates in costume standing in front of colored spinning party lights.  It was good though to let that reality go and expereince the whole thing in the underlying metaphors I was confronted with all evening.",
  "I look forward to experimenting more with 4-aces in the future and under drastically different circumstances, in order to see just how much of my enjoyment with the substance was based on the drug or the environment I took it in.</p>"
