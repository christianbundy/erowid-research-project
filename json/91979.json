 "report": "<p>I first heard about 2-CI in the bathroom at my high school. A few of my friends were in there and they were talking about psychedelics. Me, being the drug fiend I am, was very interested. They were discussing something called 2-CI, which they claimed to be a synthetic candy-flip. So clearly, I was interested. One kid said he was going to order some soon, and so I hoped to obtain some when he did.</p><p>Now, lets back up. A little bit of important background in my life, I am diagnosed with Treatment Resistant Depression and at the time I was taking 1300 mg of Lithium daily, as well as 20 mg of Celexa daily. I always pride myself in doing research before I try a drug, and so I instantly looked for complications between these prescriptions and this famed 2-CI. I saw a few instances of seizure when Lithium was combined with LSD, however, I naively believed that I would be fine with 2-CI. That was a stupid assumption.</p><p>It started at a party. I was having a good time, smoking a few bowls and just chilling. And then all of a sudden my friend walks in the door saying he just bought fat doses of 2-CI. I was very interested, and excited. I without thinking paid the man for a dose, but alas, he had no scale. So he hand divided the doses, I got what I would estimate to be a very large dose, somewhere around 30mg of the stuff, maybe even more.</p><p>T +0:00 I take the dose in what I believe was a time release capsule at about 8 P.M. For the next two hours I feel like nothing is taking effect. I get a little bummed and take a trip with my friends to CVS.</p><p>T +1:30 We are at CVS and the initial visuals start. My mind seems really off too. Things start to move around a lot, although its not as intense as I would have hoped it would be. At least, not yet.</p><p>T +2:00 We are back at my friends house at the party and I start to trip really hard. Everything looks like it is pixelated and the pixels are moving back and forth past each other really fast. I still have a small grip on my thoughts at this point however, this grip soon came to an end.</p><p>T +4:00 - T + 6:00 I am completely mental at this point. I honestly can't remember a single thing that actually happened at this point. All I can remember are the horrific, gory images flashing before my eyes. I was literally no longer in my friends house. I was in a house yes, but it was not a place that I recognized. The rooms were different. All I could see were my close friends, who were now gathered around me as I was completely delusional, being ripped apart by unknown forces. Peoples ears were being ripped off and they were bleeding from every part of their bodies. I remember at one point I bit my friends finger, and I could have sworn that I bit it off since I felt a pool of blood explode in my mouth. Although, in reality, I did not even break the skin. I would look down at my arms, and the scars and cuts I had there (from self-inflicted injury) were dancing around my arm. It was terrifying. These horrific images lasted for what I could only imagine was hours, however, I am a little shaky on the whole time factor seeing as I was tripping so insanely hard.</p><p>During this horrific aspect of the trip I had what was probably the most confusing revelation of my life. I remember I was sitting in a bath tub looking up at all my friends who were sitting around me on chairs. I don't believe this actually happened this way, but that is how I remember it. They were looking at me with smiles as I tried to process the meaning of life vocally. I remember saying something like, 'It is the last thing you will expect to need that will save you.' And then all of a sudden, I figured it out, I honestly can't remember what the answer was. But all my friends (who probably were just a hallucination) cheered and said 'You did it! You figured it out.' I instantly yelled at them, telling them they were cocksuckers and that if they knew what I was trying to figure out all that time they could have told me. Apparently I did yell at them, although they had no idea why I was yelling since they never actually talked to me about 'figuring it out'. For awhile I remember stumbling around the house screaming 'HOPE FOR THE FUTURE!' I felt really hopeful for some reason. Which is weird because I am a really depressed person.</p><p>T +7:00 - T +8:00 I remember at some point having what felt like a mildly lucid moment. I was on some bed with my girlfriend and I was trying to apologize to her for the horrific experience that I was putting everyone through. I was throwing up almost all night, and I was being extremely violent towards everyone I came in contact with. I even hit my girlfriend. I was out of control. However, while I was trying to speak to her, I couldnt do it. Literally, I stuttered over every word. It came out like I-I-I-I- a-a-a-m-m-m s-s-s-s-o-o-o-r-r-r-y-y-y. I couldnt stop talking like that. It scared the hell out of me. The next thing I remember I am walking out of the main house and towards the kid's garage. I climb the stairs to the finished part of the garage and see some kids playing video games. I look at the screen, and then something goes wrong. I feel my mouth twist to what felt like a vertical position, as opposed to the normal horizontal position. Blood poured from my mouth and I hit the floor. I was having a seizure.</p><p>T +9:00 - T +10:00 The next thing I remember I am in an ambulance. The officers and EMTs are all making fun of me for doing 2-CI seeing as they have never heard of it or anything. I remember being really disoriented and still very out of it. They gave me seizure medication and I spent the night hooked up to IVs in a hospital bed. To make things worse, I had visible self-inflicted cuts on my arm. And so, this trip to the hospital landed me in an inpatient mental program.</p><p>All in all, be careful what drugs you mix. The trip was horrific, and when I say horrific I mean I had flashbacks and night terrors about the trip for over a month after it occurred. I am just finally starting to get over the experience three months later. I will never forget the horrific things I saw that night. The blood, the gore, the violence, the horror. It was scarring. I will also never forget that revelation I had. I still to this day ponder what 'Hope' I figured out. I am sure that there are parts of the trip I don't remember, but I think that is for the best.</p><p>Please heed my warning, and be careful when you put substances into your body, especially when you are prescribed daily pharmaceuticals.</p>",
