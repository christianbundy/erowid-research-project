 "report": "<p>I submitted a report before but I had not known the real power of the Wavy Cap until now. It all started on a rather boring day and my friend and I where going to purchase some shrooms off a fellow shroomer because we woke up that morning too late to really go. We sat around and smoked cigarettes for an hour or so and desided to go visit my friends brother for awhile. Once we got to my friends brothers house we all got to talking about how beautiful the spot is where all of our friends and us go to get Psilocybe cyanescens and how the cops are watching it now and so on and so forth when we desided fuck it. We where gonna go down to this magical spot and pick all we can. This spot is one of the most beautiful spots in the forest I have ever seem. The mushrooms grow every where. And it's wild how the shrooms change when we pick them and bruise all those cool shades of brown and blue on the gills. We loaded our pockets and where spooked out of the forest by other people who where probably narks and really weren't there for nothing but to ruin some ones life.</p><p>So we hopped into the car and road our way back to OH. Now that we where back at my friends house (Lets just call him Dough-Nut) we threw all we picked into a kettle and made tea. Dough-nut let the water with the mushrooms in it simmer for a little while and strained it off into normal tea. We both drank the two glasses and drove back down to the Lake where I live. In 15 minutes we both started to feel the effects. (Like my brain is melting in my skull. And I always get this cold feeling.) Dough-nut and I walked across my uncles drive way where he parked into my uncles house becase we where hoping to get a joint from my cousin to mellow the mushroom buzz. We watch my cousin and one of his friends play playstation but I just couldn't handle being in the house at the time. So I told My cousin I was leaving and Told Dough-nut to come with me for a walk to my dock. As we started to walk I felt that giddy kind of energy. I started to talk about how I love how these things make me feel and how sometimes if I look at something I can only hear that thing and nothing else.</p><p>And we both kept on walking until we got to our destination. As soon as I got to the dock it started to kick in hard. I was locked in to these trees which seemed to breath like in-hale and ex-hale and was bitching about my stomach. It ended up to be gas as I belched in releaf. We both grew bored rather quick and desided to go to my house again. This time I could feel the different emotions all wrapped up inside me and changing all the time. My vision became bright and beautiful and everything green seemed to glow. We both noticed the same type of this and we just kept going up the hill to my house. We walked back in to see my cusin and his friend toking a a big joint. I asked to hit it and so did Dough-nut and we started to laugh and say 'MAN AM I FRIEING' and 'God I am stoned'. Just ripped out of our minds. The Colors on my cousins wall seemed to move. And I watched them dance all alonge the room. I shook my head and went to the bathroom to try to pull myself together. And still I look to the wall and I see the flowers that are on the wallpaper crawl up and up to nothing.</p><p>Wierd, I though and just went on my business. After taking a reall wild piss I told my friend Dough-nut to come smoke a cigarette with me in the living room and watch some Cartoons. We sat for a little while and went outside over and over. We where smoking outside and we hear things. Voices. And I still was having that what ever I looked at is all that was there sindrome. So we sat on the coach this time for awhile and started to really get sunk in the mood. My friend started to freak... 'I am hallucinating' 'HOLY SHIT I AM HALLUCINATING' And I tried to tell him to calm down but Bazame!!!!!!!!!! It was on. Dough-nut ran outside and stated to vomit. The sounds that came out of this man would make satan piss his pants. After that was all over his eyes just stared at me like a scared rabbit and I told him he was ok but his trip was going the wrong way and it is hard to help someone like that.</p><p>He started to tell me how he missed his lost family members and I was still tripping myself noticing that the sky was chnging color and the clouds where comming in to ingulf us. I watched all the trees bend As I wanted them to and for some reason was saying things I didn't even think of. I think it helped him and helped me. After all the peaking was through and we started to gain back true knowledge again we vowed never to do it again. At least for a few years or so but I will tell you this. I found god and I do recommend Mushrooms to the spiritually lost. But do not abuse it's visions. It's not all fun and games when you are taking your good friend to the looney bin.</p>",
