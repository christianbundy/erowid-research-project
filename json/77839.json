 "report": "<p>Background: Generally, I'm not too experienced in drugs so far.  I've smoked quite a bit of weed in my life, drank a few times, snorted hydrocodone / Vicodin (not recommended), and snorted Ritalin and Adderall.  The only drugs out of these that I've used repeatedly are weed and Vicodin.  I've only snorted a few times, and have discovered that crushing them and mixing the dust in water, or using the Cold Water Extraction method, works much better than snorting.</p><p>Setting: A typical Saturday.  I work at the local Taco Time, usually at the register, taking customers orders, and keeping the lobby clean.  I was inside most of the time that the effects of the drug took place, either at home or at work.</p><p>Description: The night before I had spent the night at a friend's house, and gotten about 3 1/2 - 4 hours of sleep.  Oddly, I wasn't too tired when I got home that morning.  However, I thought that if I continued through the day without a little more sleep at least, I was bound to crash.  I decided to take a short, hour and a half long nap, but I kind of regretted that.  I had very strange dreams and woke up feeling nauseous, dizzy, unmotivated, and achey. </p><p>A few weeks before, I had gotten four 30mg Vyvanse capsules from my friend, 'D'.  I decided that, based on what I had read about Vyvanse, that this would be a good time to take it since I had to work and I was feeling sick. The research I had done implied that it was a mild stimulant, similar to Adderall, but a bit more mild and much longer lasting.  Right before I left, at 11:44 AM, I took three of the 30mg pills, totaling 90mg. This is where the timeline starts.</p><p>Disclaimer: I was at work the whole time, not at home taking notes every once in a while, so it's just a bit fuzzy.  I tried my best to log how I was feeling, and the time, every once in a while.</p><p>T + 0:00 -- It's 11:44 AM right now, just got out of the shower, about to head to work.  I've read that it takes about fifteen to twenty minutes for the first effects to be noticed, and my shift starts at noon, so I figure this is a good time.  At the moment I'm feeling pretty dizzy, a bit nauseous, and pretty weak.  Overindulged a bit at breakfast.</p><p>T + 15:00 -- No noticeable effect yet.  Just arrived at work, but I was about five minutes early, so I went in the one-person bathroom and just sat for a couple minutes, breathing deeply.  I clocked on at 11:58 AM.</p><p>T + 20:00 -- My sick feelings have sort of faded away.  Today is Saturday, meaning we typically get waves of people.  That's what I'm expecting, but it's not always like that.  Me and one of my co-workers are both assigned to the 'front' job, which entails taking orders, keeping lobby clean, restocking lids and sauces, handing out orders, etc.  I'm feeling something, but it's not too noticeable, so I decide to take my last 30mg pill here.  Tried to swallow without water, and it got stuck to the back of my throat, but I washed it down successfully.</p><p>T + 30:00 -- I've very gradually began to feel the effects, and I'm pretty sure that they're in full effect now.  Any feelings of sickness are completely gone, and I'm feeling very energetic.  It's different than Ritalin, though, in that I can control it when I'm not doing something, without tapping fingers, feet, etc. </p><p>T + 45:00 -- The Vyvanse is very casual but very effective.  So far we haven't been getting 'waves' of customers, but instead a steady flow of customers.  Not too many, but just enough so that we're keeping very busy.  Time is passing extremely slowly, but I don't mind because I'm having fun.</p><p>T + 60:00 -- We've been keeping up with customers, and I feel much more sharp at my jobs.  I feel an incredible urge to be nice to everyone and to do as much work as I can.  I'm very confident in my social skills at this point, and am connecting with customers more than I ever have before.</p><p>T + 75:00 -- One of the most noticeable effects for me is the distortion of time.  It seems like it's been almost three hours, but it's only been a little over one hour.  Still, I'm enjoying my job and doing it well.  I definitely have a buzz, but it's pretty moderate.  Still very enjoyable.</p><p>T + 90:00 -- I only have half an hour left on my shift, but I have hardly gotten any of my 'shift change' (position-specific duties performed before you go off shift, or when others come on shift) which for me is things such as washing tables, restocking lids, cups, ice, and straws, refilling and cleaning the 'salsa bar', etc.  I feel very determined to get through as much as I can.</p><p>T + 115:00 -- Five minutes until my shift is *technically* up, and I'm not ready.  I manage to finish washing tables, filling the Ice, and taking out the garbages in five minutes, which is virtually unheard of.  I wouldn't define my feeling as 'high,' but 'mildly buzzed' seems accurate.  It's a complete body high, except for the time distortion and being as nice as possible to customers.</p><p>T + 130:00 -- My shift ended a while ago, but the supervisor told me that I could stay clocked on and get a few more things done.  I am supposed to go to a friends house though, but he has to do some homework first, so I have to hang around until he gives me the 'OK' to come over. </p><p>T + 150:00 -- I 'clocked off' (officially came off shift) twenty minutes ago, but I stayed there and continued to help with whatever I could--taking orders, washing trays, etc.  Even though I'm not being payed, I feel really good about helping out, like it's my natural environment.  I feel like the Vyvanse has motivated me to make others feel the way Im feeling  very happy, energetic, and positive.  Everyone compliments me and thanks me today.  Everything is great.</p><p>T + 165:00 -- A close friend of mine and his buddy arrive, and we are both surprised and pleased to see each other.  I tell them that I'm going to go converse with my friends.  I meet a new person, and immediately become friendly with him.  We have a great discussion about many deep and important subjects.  Usually this would be uncharacteristic of me.  I tend to be shy around a lot of new people, especially when theyre friends of my friends.  However, I put that aside completely and wasnt afraid to be myself; something I believe to be a direct effect of the drug.  Im not as afraid that Im not pleasing someone, so I am just myself.</p><p>T + 250:00 -- We talked for over an hour until they finally had to go.  At this point I call my friend, who informs me that he hasn't finished his work and can't hang out today.  I don't care too much.  I just go home.</p><p>T + 300:00 -- For five hours, the buzz has been consistent.  I've been talkative, comfortable, and warm inside.  I am being considerably nicer to my siblings, and call several friends and talk to them.</p><p>T + 420:00 -- It's been a good seven hours since taking the pills.  The buzz has declined just a bit, but I'm still feeling good.  I've noticed that even though I haven't eaten since breakfast at 8:00 AM, which was just a toasted bagel with butter, I am not hungry at all.  This is probably because amphetamines have appetite-suppressing qualities.  This is the only thing I'm concerned about.  I kind of wish I wanted to eat.</p><p>T + 540:00 -- It has now been nine hours since I took the first three Vyvanse.  I'm a bit achey, and have had horrible cotton-mouth for a bit over two hours.  It is hard to swallow, and I'm constantly swishing water in my mouth.  It's not too bad, but slightly annoying.  Energy is definitely gone, and I believe that fatigue from lack of food and sleep is setting in.  Still not tired or hungry, but the computer screen is starting to play weird tricks on me and my limbs occasionally feel like they're twisted like licorice--weird!  I should go to sleep, but there's no chance of that, so I just write this incredibly long experience and chat with a friend on Skype.</p><p>Conclusion: Sorry this was so long.  Vyvanse was a curious experience.  It was basically like Adderall, with a few differences.  One, there was no rush.  The buzz definitely came on gradually.  Second, the buzz was a bit milder, but lasted MUCH longer.  Also, I felt much more sociable and very content throughout the buzz.  I think that it as a pleasant experience, but I don't see myself doing it too many more times in the future.  It seems like it would have some addictive potential, because the feeling of happiness was wonderful.  Also, I don't want to be up really late at night, and I prefer to eat during the day.</p>",
