 "report": "<p>Recently, one of my friends acquired a bottle of morphine pills. She came over on a Saturday afternoon with them and we decided to take some. I have taken morphine twice before previously, but in very small amounts with no bad results. We cut up one of the pills, which she snorted. She also took one of the 30mg tablets orally. I swallowed 2 of the little purple pills with a glass of water on a empty stomach.</p><p>About half an hour later, we felt the morphine start to kick in. It was a light, pleasant euphoria and we were enjoying it, smoking cigarettes and talking. After a while, we both got hungry and decided to go out for dinner. We walked the 3 blocks to Nathans. I ate 2 hot dogs and a glass of lemonade. Then we left and got on a bus to the mall. his is where it started to get bad. The minute the bus started moving, my stomach began to turn. I felt nauseous and could feel my dinner coming back up my throat. I managed to make it to the mall without puking and felt a little better once we got outside into the cool air. We went into a bookstore and I started to feel sick again. My friend led me to the bathroom quickly. I gulped down some water from a fountain and shakingly made my way into a stall. I stuck my finger down my throat and tried to throw up, but couldn't. I just coughed a few times. Thinking I felt better, I left the bathroom, only to be hit with another wave of nausea 2 minutes later. I ran back into the bathroom and threw up most of the water and food in my stomach. Feeling a lot better, I washed my hands and wiped the makeup running on my face.</p><p>We sat outside and I sipped a can of soda I had bought to help my stomach. I was feeling okay for a while and managed to get along normally. Then I started feeling extremely tired and heavy, my eyes could hardly stay open as I sat on a chair in some store, trying not to fall asleep. My friend suggested we get something to eat and we ventured to a ice cream store. She seemed to feel fine while I still felt like I was going to pass out. She bought me a cup of sherbert ice cream which I slowly ate. We waited outside of a store for her dad to pick us up and take us home. </p><p>As he drove, I seriously felt like throwing up again. I barely made it home, stumbling up the steps as fast as I could. I practically crawled into my kitchen and gulped down a glass of water. Then I ran into the bathroom, pushed my fingers down my throat once more and violently puked for a good 5 minutes until I was coughing up bile. I repeated this pattern for a hour. Drink a quart of water, wait a few minutes and throw up. At around 11, I was so weak I almost fell asleep on the bathroom floor. Feeling as if my body was a limp noodle, I pulled the covers over my head and went to sleep for 15 hours.</p><p>Never again will I take morphine. It was all nice and fun for a few hours, but it wasn't worth getting sick over.</p>"
