  "The other night I was fortunate to be able to try some Salvia for the first time. A friend and I had just purchased some 5x extact, and by the time night rolled around, I was getting anxious to try some. I felt a little jittery about it, so I decided I would wait until I was comfortable before smoking any. At one point I noticed that my nerves had calmed down considerably, so I loaded a small amount into my water pipe, inhaled what I would consider to be a medium-sized hit, and held it in for about 20 seconds.",
  "As I exhaled, I began to feel that there was a large tree behind me, wrapping its roots around me and pulling me towards it. I realized that it wanted to tell me something, but at this point I was starting to come down, and I failed to glean any information from it. I was disappointed. I felt like a door had been opened, and beyond it was an experience of great intensity and power, but I had been unable to pass though it. I was determined to try again.",
  "About an hour later, I decided it was time to revisit Salvia space. I loaded up a considerable amount into my pipe and inhaled it all in one massive drag. What happened next is almost beyond words...",
  "I layed back, feeling the effects of the drug coming on rather quickly. I saw my friend's hammock suspended in the air above me, so I reached out and grabbed it. At that moment, I was transported to some kind of playground,where I was holding on to a chainlink fence. I could hear the playful voices of children all around me, and this made me happy. I saw a large building in the distance, and a school bus passing in front of it. Suddenly I was on the school bus, and looking at the building as I passed. I became aware that there were millions of rooms in this building, all of them quite similar. I began focusing on one of them, and I realized that it was the room I was in, complete with my friend sitting there looking at me. It seemed strange that he was staring at me, because I felt that I should be the observer in this situation. As I looked at my friend, and the room around me, I slowly started to drift back into reality. About ten minutes later, I felt completely normal again and smoked some cannabis to finish out the night.",
  "This experience was very positive. I feel that I learned that I am only a small part of the massive aggregation of humans on our planet. I think I will make further contact with Salvia in the future."
