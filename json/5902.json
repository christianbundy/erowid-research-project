 "report": [
  "I'm 16 and of course I choose to be somewhat experimental, but in the safest way possible. I consider myself fairly cautious with what I put in my body. Ive taken a crack at only few drugs, and I've stayed content with mostly weed. This was my first time I'd tried morphine and I hope on exploiting this drug again some day.",
  "It was during the longest summer Ive been able to have away from school. I'd been to America with one friend and smoked as much weed as we could buy with the generous donation of travelling money from our parents. That was a great time but thats another story. I'd just got back and was off on another trip to Greece to meet up with my family in Greece a few weeks before the Olympics. And for these few weeks I had nothing to smoke and only little to drink. Very disappointing.",
  "I got back with a smile on my face as I had saved just over 1/4 ounce of resin. Now this is where the party starts. A friend rings. Folks are camping an hours walk out of town. Theres no chance my parents will let me out. And the way I escaped was what I consider as mission impossible 3! At one point I was just outside with a choice of running in front of my parents open window where a motion light would switch on, or run the other way where theres no where to run on except gravel. With the open window I would have been screwed if it wert for a loud jet that gave me my chance to run for it.",
  "I arrived with my heart beating, legs aching and scared to death that I might be receiving a call any second from my parents. I greeted my friends and gave them their gifts from Greece. Good to see everyone. But I was still nervous. The fire was warm as I began to somewhat relax and believe Ive gotten away and escaped. I wonder into the large 9-man tent, welcomed by a circle of friends passing 2 large joints around a dim lantern making everything just visible. A space was made for me.",
  "Just as I got comfortable on the hard rocky ground my good friend who is into drugs more then most people I know pulls out a pack of morphine pills and casually says with a half wrecked tinge if I want any cause they feel immense. I probably trust him most because of the amount of experience hes already had with other things, and where to get the best cleanest stuff.",
  "I asked why he had those and he said he couldn't get any weed. Fair enough. As he handed me 2 pills and some coke to chase it down with. A few friends around the circle give me info on when it'll kick in and not to drink because its an opiate. Well its too late now to enjoy the bottle of Greek drink I'd brought.",
  "The night continued as the joints went round and the party rolled on and I thought either my tolerance was much lower then I thought or this morphine was definitely taking effect. I didn't have a watch and I didn't take to much notice of time. We had a portable cd player with some music on, that was unfamiliar to me witch would frustrate me but I felt more mellow then ever feeling so much more comfortable in the hard rocky ground then I should be.",
  "I went outside to search for my Mountain dew with I'd saved for a good occasion like this one. It took me a considerable amount of time to go through my bag with only a few random items in to retrieve it. I felt so relaxed that I couldn't be bothered to walk 4ft to the tent to go back in and instead sat round the camp fire with only a little drunk conversation and people making out.",
  "After getting back in the tent and finishing the mountain dew along with a joint we decided it would be a good idea to set up a few lugs. Oh it felt soo good. I discovered I was fairly careless with my possetoins and myself now. The can had gone missing and was later found empty and my little bit of weed had un-noticeable dropped on the ground. No worries it was found and smoked. I sat back to enjoy my experience any my eyes closed. No way was I ready to sleep and people asked me if my friend and me were sleeping. We must have been feeling the same. Great in a bliss of self-thought.",
  "We got up and went outside to watch a can of deodorant explode on the fire and both me and my good drug friend were thinking some extremely odd thoughts each quickly getting covered up by the next thought before you could fully grasp the first thought.",
  "Me and that friend grabbed a few sleeping bags - didn't care who's they were along with the cd player and music, didnt care what music. We made it to his tent where we had stashed munchie food for us and enjoyed them greatly.",
  "We both just half collapsed and felt paralysed as we lay on the ground. My friend puked at around 4 am. I felt fine. 20 minutes later I decided it would be a good idea to hit a bong and begin to stubble home. I noticed half way back that I'd forgotten at least half of my stuff.I arrived home just as it was getting light enough for me to pass the motion light and not turn it on. I fell asleep and was having the best sleep for a while until my mom came in to wake me up for work. She said I'd woken her up from my snoring. Ive never snored and havent had any kind of family history of snores.",
  "I felt real strange. With a clear mind but sluggish body that couldn't keep up with my mind. I'd recommend not working the next day after doing this. It was one good night with only a small comedown. Great drug."
