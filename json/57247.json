 "report": "<p>I am notorious for not being able to concentrate or able to follow my points in arguments, conversations ect. I also have attention deficit disorder which in my case significantly hinders my ability to concentrate at times. I often find myself rereading passages in books and articles because I lose focus on the content. After going through some serious self questioning times, I realized that if I had a better memory I could better define myself and my values in terms of other people and their values. After reading others' experiences with DMAE I decided it would be a worthwhile investment to purchase some of the stuff.</p><p>I bought a bottle of 100 capsules that contain 100 mg of DMAE per capsule for 8 dollars and some odd cents at a local health foods and supplement store. About an hour after purchase I decided to administer the white capsule and see what it does.</p><p>When I got home I received a call from my friend who enjoys debating things, I usually cant convince him on most subjects of conversation, But when he called we started up an important debate about the fallacies of one of my ex-friends------ long story short I was able to nail down all areas of this debate to the fullest extent. My memory seemed to be in overdrive, It was like I was in a library of my memories and I had the ability to pinpoint specific ones I needed to back up my points. The speed and efficiency in which I was utilizing my points, language, and logic was something I dont do with such precision. I left my friend thoroughly convinced of how I felt towards this individual and I had shifted my friends perspective as well.</p><p>The next day I took another 100mg (one capsule) and went to school, I had followed everything my professors were discussing with awesome focus, I had taken extensive notes and really absorbed the class material. I took DMAE the morning of a test. While I was taking the test I hadnt studied very extensively for, memories of being in class while reviewing material seemed to resurface  this is something that never has really occurred to me before, when I got my test back on it I had received 87 percent on it.  I read an entire 150 page novel yesterday without rereading passages for clarity, I was able to absorb the book.</p><p>The effects of DMAE are definitely apparent. For me it seems to temporarily disable Attention deficit disorder, allowing me to focus and concentrate significantly more than usual. I started out on just taking a one capsule at a time and I received all DMAEs rewards. I owe a little credit to DMAE for my self discovery in part with DMAE as well, I can focus on issues while in the midst of thought.</p>",
