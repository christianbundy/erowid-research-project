  "I was living in mexico for 5 months straight, previously bound to NYC metropolitan lifestyle my whole life.",
  "Once I got to mexico, I was somewhat careful on what I ate and drank.",
  "I've had digestive problems since I was a kid, however, on my last days in mexico I suspect it was a chicken soup that threw me over the border.  I thought I was going to die in the boonies of mexico: diahrrea and stomach pains for 3 days straight. ",
  "Luckily on the third day a friend of mine suggested I try two normal sized peyote buttons.  I had heard earlier of its astringent and anti microbial effects so thought it may help...",
  "After chewing and ingesting the 2 buttons (not a particularly strong dose) followed by a little clean water I felt tremendously better within a couple of hours.  Like new.  I even went to the bathroom like a man.",
  "It made my day and the next, both physically and mentally. Unfortunately, however, once it was out of my system. back came moctezuma's revenge.",
  "I took the buttons around 9pm, effects subsiding by the morning.  The rest of that day and into the evening I was fine and slept alright, but the following day came back the GI upset.  At least my mood was better for the next 2 days.",
  "I ate very little that morning and afternoon so that the buttons would have a stonger affect."
