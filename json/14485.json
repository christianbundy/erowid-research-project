 "report": [
  "I had been going through a bad break up with my g/f and decided i needed some healing.  I had been saving 25 mg of dpt which i had never tried before. I brought along a gram of mushrooms just incase the DPT didn't do the trick. I also had some fresh dried salvia leaves. My set was one of sadness but hoping to find healing. I was with 3 friends all experienced trippers. They would eat mushrooms and babysit me on the DPT. We got to my friends apartment around 6. Had a medicine wheel ceremony and got underway by 6:30 pm .",
  "I insuflated half in each nostril. Slight burn and the drip wasn't too bad. It was nothing after trying Anadenanthera Culumbrina.  Effects started in 10 min. By twenty minutes i was sitting indian style on the floor rocking back and fourth. Somehow I was a monk meditating high in the Himalaya's . Soon my heart was racing soooo hard I thought I might die.It felt like my blood pressure was so high it was making my eyes throb in pain as if they where about to burst. I began to have muscle tremors(I'm very prone to getting tremors from other experiences). The tremors scared the hell out of me . For maybe 15 minutes my hands when relaxed where tight like a claw or the hand of a cripple. I would go between laying down and sitting up. My entire body felt just like when your arm falls asleep and is waking up. Its torture! The muscle spasms almost hurt.  I was so scared that i sniffed the remaining dpt out of my nasal cavity and swallowed it because I didn't want to go anyhigher. How much I absorbed before doing that I dont know but it cerainly wasn't all of it .",
  "After a really rough half an hour of coming up my body smoothed out . Soon the muscle spasm went away and I took a giant hit of salvia to aleviate the muscle tension. For me salvia is very relaxing and for ten minutes i felt better. The experience was mostly like being on salvia it overpowered the DPT, I guess you could say. Soon everything was ok except my neck which had been hurting when i started . I walked around . It was like being on a high dose of lsd . The visuals started to get going and it was beautiful. I would completely lose track of what i was thinking of and realize i hadn't thought about my girl in a while and that reasured me that in time she'll be a distant memory. After about three hours i was coming down fast and wasn't ready to come back. I ate the gram of shrooms. The shrooms slowed the remaining muscle tremors. They seemed to tell me DPT is not perfect and that they would be helping to heal me and fix the tremors. This they did. They seemed to cleanse me . I smoked salvia a few more times that night. It was hard not to just be in a state of rainbow bliss. I felt healed when it was all over.After my body smoothed out i would have taken more DPT if i had some weighed on hand.",
  "I think 50 mg would be too much for me. I think it could have been dangerous for me at that level. I'm very sensitive to it as are most people who manifest the muscle tremor effect. I liked it alot better then 5meodmt. I would repeat but take it slowly to smooth the transition and hopefully elimante muslce tremors.DPT T IS FOR TORTURE"
