 "report": "<p>Dose:</p><p>20mg 2C-B for me, 25mg 2C-B for T</p><p>Mindset:</p><p>We had planned to take the 2C-B on Friday night for the whole week. But then Friday rolled along and I didn't really feel like tripping anymore. It had been a rough week in terms of classes (exam week, and I was behind in my work) and personal / relationship issues. So part of me didn't want to trip last night, and the other part of me didn't want to back out of my plans to trip with T. Plus I did want to see what 2C-B was all about. I decided on dumping about 1/5th of the material out of a 25mg cap, leaving me with about 20mg.</p><p>The Trip</p><p>So we dropped in around 9:00pm. By 10:00 we were both feeling a bit of a buzz and a tiny bit of psychedelia creeping in. Maybe half an hour after that we were asking each other if we thought we were tripping yet... we both thought so but it was minor. So we loaded up a bowl and smoked it. As I smoked it I looked out my window and the lawn outside seemed to be rearranging itself into patterns, but less obviously so than I would have expected by this point had I taken 2C-I.</p><p>So now we were stoned, and put on some music. We both felt the trip creeping up a bit stronger and mixing with the cannabis high. The first things I noticed were that if I focused on something long enough, I could zoom in my vision on it. There were also transparent bright yellow and blue patterns forming in the air, again similar to 2C-I but brighter and a bit more random. We both agreed at this point that the trip was 'weird'. Neither of us were really digging it. My body didn't seem to like it either, and I started to get some minor muscle tremors and twitches.</p><p>By about 11:00 I was feeling the body high from the 2C-B pretty strongly. It felt like a mix between 2C-I and mdma. I felt like there was tons of energy flowing through my body, and there wasn't an outlet for it. This energy was fickle in its nature... sometimes it would feel like a euphoric mdma-like buzz, but it was also causing my entire body to have muscle tremors as if I was shivering from the cold. I commented on how distracting it was, and alerted T to my condition. He put on some calm music and suggested breathing exercises. So I crawled up in bed, lay down, and tried to calm myself as much as possible. For short periods of time, I found, I was able to curb the tremors. During those periods of time I felt one of the best buzzes that can be had. It was like an mdma buzz but less 'fuzzy' and more intense.</p><p>Also I was starting to get some visuals that I thought looked like a cross between 2C-I and shrooms. I say 2C-I because it shared much of the typical phenethylamine patterns and appearance. I say shrooms because 2C-B seemed to be much more creative and unpredictable in its visuals than 2C-I, which never surprises me at all. The visuals were of about the same intensity as 18mg 2C-I or 2 grams of good mushrooms. But they were brighter, and with more colorful halos around lights and such.</p><p>Anyway, so I lay in my bed listening to tunes and staring at my ceiling for probably an hour and a half with tremors that were sometimes mild, sometimes non-existant, and sometimes pretty intense with my whole body shaking. My heartrate didn't seem to be affected by the 2C-B (at least beyond the normal increase the THC would have made), so I wasn't worried about the tremors. The same thing happened to one of my friends the first time he had 2C-I, and he dealt with it and had a good trip.</p><p>So by 1:00am we were both tired of chilling in my room. I forgot to mention that T never really got much effects beyond some minor visuals and a nice buzz. So we went downstairs to watch a movie.</p><p>Problem Child 2 was on TV. I have never seen this movie before and it cracked me up non stop. My tremors had pretty much gone away, and the psychedelic effects were also gone by around 1:30am. It was a very quick trip with a sudden rise in effects and a quick drop-off. But I was left with a very nice buzz for another couple hours, which relaxed me and felt nice after spending a couple hours with muscle tremors. So I really got into the movie... I thought it was brilliant really. I don't know if I would normally watch it or not</p><p>By 2:30am T was falling asleep and went back to his place to kick it. He seemed somewhat dissapointed in the night, because he wanted a balls-out trip. I stayed up for a little while longer watching trash on TV and smoking a spliff.</p><p>3:30am fell asleep no problem. Probably could have fallen asleep at 2:00am if I wanted to.</p><p>----</p><p>I think this trip would have been 100% fun if it weren't for the tremors. Any ideas on how to avoid them? I took some magnesium when I first started to notice them and it didn't seem to combat them very well.</p><p>My hope is that the tremors were a result of the tension I had from the past week and going into the trip. Next time I take this I'll make sure I'm much more relaxed and actually feel like tripping. And I'll definitely take it with my girlfriend because 2C-B did feel empathogenic/entactogenic to me. I think it would be just as good as E in the sack.</p>",
