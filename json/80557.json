 "report": "<p>METHYLONE, MEPHEDRONE AND CAFFIENE MIX</p><p>2:42pm: Ive tried this mix maybe 5 or 6 times now, but have given it a break for a couple of weeks so hopefully my tolerance to these substances has reduced over this time. Measured out roughly 300mg of the bk-MDMA and 4MMC combined, tipped into a shot glass, mixed with cordial and downed the remedy until nothing visible remained. Lets hope for a good trip!</p><p>T+10: Starting to recognise the little signs that this stuff works; the growing warmth, the slight prickles and nuisances felt on the skin and mainly facial area. Nothing special yet as expected, but just a good indication of the things likely to come!</p><p>T+20: Motor skills improving allowing me to play guitar with ease; speed of thought increasing even if a little fuzzy round the temples, but still clear and concise where needed. May decide to gum another 50 mg or so just to speed up the process and add a few extra layers to the equation.</p><p>T+30: One dabble from the bag later and Im still waiting to come up. Beginning to feel a touch heavy headed, but only a little. Gums taste nice and tangy and are starting to become numb from the recent dosage.  Starting to experience a pressurised sensation round my head like a thin wall being built, a good sign that my mind will feel wired in the not so distant future. Going to watch some TV and will report back in 20 minutes.</p><p>T+50: Much the same as before but with mildly elevated effects. Feeling heavier in the head and mind is sensing its detachment from the body, similar to that of speed or BZP when your body can feel immensely tired, but the mind feel ready to go. However, not quite on the same level yet. Ive decided to add a can of cider to mix since I have not yet experiment these research chemicals with alcohol until now. Feel it necessary to do so within the comfort and safety of my own home before I attempt something on a much larger scale when partying out in town.</p><p>T+1 hr 20: Starting to wonder whether I have developed a tolerance to these two substances or possibly I need to separate them and alter my dosage. Not much has changed since the last update, but perhaps Im being too impatient and need to let them settle into my system before jumping to conclusions.</p><p>T+1hr 30: Feeling ALOT better now. This may be due to arrival of some friends and my mood has lifted and possibly this has affected the reception of the drugs into my system.  Fingers want to type and fidget as my mind is unable to deliver the words onto my keyboard. I may sound like Im rambling and I probably am, but this is a signal that Im finally starting to come up, be it somewhat to a lesser extent than previously experienced.</p><p>T+1hr 40: Alive and kicking, this drug is active and making me talk, fidget and want to do more and more. Off out for a while to pick up supplies and will be back later to report on the later stages of my trip. Hopefully I will report a positive and expected experience, but gummed an extra 50mg just in case. This stuff makes me do this because I am enjoying the gradually increasing feeling and only want to make sure I experience the most out of it, hence very moorish!</p><p>T+ Many Hours Later: I hit my peak between the 2 and 3 hour period, experiencing extreme restlessness, heightened alertness and a permanent smile on my face. Chewing gum was needed to help with my gurning jaw that was chattering away and I was relieved that I could achieve the state of euphoria and mental wellbeing I was hoping for. At about 3 and half hours I started smoking cannabis to regulate and build on my condition, which in my opinion (and that of all my friends) can only do better for the trip.</p><p>The pot calms down all the negative effects of the bk-MDMA and 4MMC mix such as uncontrollable jittering, fidgeting and shaking, whilst also composes my mind to a state where speech isnt just incomprehensible gibberish.  Getting stoned is also an amazing experience since the mix keeps me wired and stops me monging out. It almost seemed as if me shaking my legs kept me buzzed and when I stopped, I felt a lot more relaxed but still awake and well. Come 2am, and 12 or so joints of AK47 and Northern Lights later, I couldnt help noticing my body was knackered, stoned and ready to mong, but my mind was still capable of a Guitar Hero sesh!</p><p>After considerable reflection and with zero to no come down, minus the fuzzy head I know to be caused by all the weed (get this from daily pot smoking), I really enjoyed both drugs, but have decided I am definitely more partial to Methylone. Having tried both separately, Methylone feels more euphoric compared to Mephedrones speed-like high. Feeling self-conscious about my heart and circulatory system, the increased heart rate and strong chest buzz that it provides means Im less likely to take it as often, siding me more towards the MDMA-like Methylone.</p><p>In conclusion, id give Methylone 8/10 and Mephedrone 7/10, but for the price I pay for these chemicals over the internet, they are definitely worth trying before they are outlawed.</p><p>Man, my jaw aches!</p>",
