 "report": "<p>I am a 20 year old English student, who is fairly well versed in the  majority of psychadelia, having tried (on many occasions) LSD, magic mushrooms, 2ct2, 2cb and 2ci, not to mention the majority of commonly available stimulant drugs (even though I'm far more comfortable with psychadelia).</p><p>A few weeks ago I had been given 60mg of 2ce by one of my friends from London, who claimed the drug was 'like 2ct2, without residual nausea'. Naturally I'd been waiting for the right opportunity to do it, and last night seemed like a prime moment - with no work to do over the next few days, nothing to attend and basically nothing to really worry about.</p><p>At about six o' clock or so, I decided to take a reasonably small dose just to see what the effects were like, to better gauge a bigger trip in the future. I wrapped 6mg in a Rizla and dropped it at about 6pm, and chilled with my other two friends, friend a</p><p>(female) and b (female). The other two did not drop with me at that time.</p><p>+1 hr: I am noticing slight distortions in my perceptions of space - there are no real visual hallucinations, more the inability to really gauge how far away things are. Somebody calls me on the phone and I get them off pretty quickly - its getting difficult to concentrate on two things at once!</p><p>+1:30: Colours are starting to become more apparent, and its the typical psychedelic colours Im used to with the phenyls - mainly deep greens and occasional purples. Still nothing too spectacular.</p><p>+2 hr: My mood has been almost completely elevated - from being pretty tired I am now awake and feeling slightly speedy rushes going through me. A & B have seen how the drug has affected me, and decide they want to be a part of it. A drops a 7mg dose with B, while I top myself up with another 5mg, then we go outside to smoke some pot.</p><p>+3hr: Now the visual element of the trip is starting. The air is becoming thicker and more static, as though it is many-layered and filled with brighter fractal light. The wall patterns are shifting slightly, and my posters seem to be coming away from the wall. During this time, A & B come up very quickly, and we enjoy sitting down in my room, talking about the softer colours.</p><p>+4hr: The main light in the room is becoming slightly too intense - I turn on a side lamp and myself and B drop again (another  4mg dose each, again wrapped in a Rizla and swallowed). Now the light intensity is down slightly, I can notice the physical properties of the drug - standard pupil expansion, followed by almost cocaine rushes of warmth and goodwill through the body. A & B are amazingly happy - something I was very relieved about due to neither of them being very well versed in psychedelic drugs. More pot now and again is added to facilitate the come-up.</p><p>+5hr: The drug is starting to take more and more of a hold over all of us - the visuals are becoming slicker and more noticeable constantly - the sides of my vision are sometimes impossible to steady, and if I look at any bright colours, they seem almost overtly extreme, and leave vivid afterimages across my eyes. Myself, A & B decide to take one last dose to push ourselves as far as possible while still maintaining safety - A takes another  3mg dose (bringing her to 10mg), B takes another 4 mg dose (bringing him to 15mg) and I take another 4mg dose (bringing me to 19mg)</p><p>+6hr: Come midnight, there are occasional foreshadowings of danger. B seemed to be going through a slightly difficult time; a general lack of understanding as to what was happening, slight paranoia (he had to be convinced for a while that the water in my room was not spiked with LSD) and a general concern for his environment. This was easily handled by him however - he went quiet for about half an hour before rejoining the conversation as normal (something very rare and impressive in a non-versed psychedelic user!) Again, marijuana seems to help even everybody out, and bring them back to normality, albeit briefly.</p><p>A was enjoying the trip, though not getting quite the visual element of myself and B - we were watching a poster of a sunset over a beach, in which the waves were lapping at the sky, the trees seemed to be pulsating and stretching away from the poster. Every inanimate object in the room seemed slightlyincorrect in its dimensions - curtains would be billowing constantly in no wind, the wardrobe seemed to be growing and shrinking, and every surface in the room seemed to be melting slightly.</p><p>At this point, I get a slightly bizarre effect I had only ever had on acid before. My vision  around the outside is balling slightly, and I get the feeling I am constantly falling forward - something which plays merry hell with my balance. This is accompanied by brief nausea, which is overcome by a few sips of water.</p><p>+8hr: The visuals seem to be integrating more with my perceived vision - though I can still see the amazing amount of colours and the movement around the room, I seem to be almost accepting them as normal, which means I am less likely to notice them. A great wave of love is felt throughout the room, and the three of us spend a good few minutes just hugging one another, and mentioning how safe we all feel taking such strong substances in good company. I am hungry but still unable to eat.</p><p>+10hr: Tiredness has started to creep in slightly - A goes upstairs to rest for a while, while me B and I decide to watch Alice in Wonderland (a standard for me while tripping!) We manage to eat some sweets which nicely boosts blood sugar, and we go outside to smoke more spliffs than the rest of the night put together. Perhaps this is to help with the slight coming down experience, I am not too sure.</p><p>+11hr: Halfway through the film, A returns, looking far more awake. The three of us finish the film, and start browsing the internet, looking for games to download, and watching videos on you tube. The visuals are still popping up every now and again, though it is mainly colour distortions again now; fractal light patterns and overemphasis of colour as opposed to any movement or true visual distortions.</p><p>+13hr: Finally make myself some food, and find after a small bowl of cereal that I am damned starving. Make a huge amount of food with A & B, finish it off, and then everyone collectively decides that it is time to go to sleep. Part ways with A & B (with another hugging session, and everyone thanking everyone else for just being there) - lie down in my bed, cover myself over, and have no trouble falling asleep almost instantly. My sleep is not great - I keep waking after short, two hour dreams, but end up waking up properly at 4pm (when Im writing this). I do not feel many traces of the hangover - my mind is slightly slower, and I am not exactly relishing the prospect of going out drinking (which I promised a friend I would do tonight!)</p><p>In conclusion, this was one of the most pleasant tripping experiences of my life. 2CE had the visual elements of acid, with the lucidity to truly enjoy it, and without the background worry of me or someone else getting lost in their own head. Have yet to see either A or B this morning - am looking forward to see how they relate the experience.</p><p>Caution should also be recommended - this drug was excellent in small doses, and a large dose was eye-opening, however I definitely reached my limit. Any more could have been quite detrimental to me, both physically and mentally.</p><p>Random</p>",
