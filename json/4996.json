 "report": "<p>Yesterday was my first time trying 2C-T-2 alone; the two previous times I combined it with 2C-T-7 (both times with 60mg 2C-T-7 and 40mg 2C-T-2) and had poor experiences.  I figured that it was probably because I had ingested more than I could handle and not the T-2 (I had done T-7 many times and had yet to not have a good time), so I decided to give T-2 a go on its own to confirm my suspicions.</p><p>1/31- I decided o be fucked up all day Saturday, so the rest of that night and up through Friday night I ate at least 3000 calories   (no sweets and very little fat) and drank at least 10 cups of water a day.</p><p>2/3- After getting off work at 7am I head home to prepare my 30mg capsule of T-2.  I was anticipating a good trip--my mind was very relaxed and physically I felt great.  I downed the capsule at 7:30am and smoked a couple bowls to further relax, so as to not be anxious while awaiting for the effects to kick in.</p><p>T+ 0:30>  I am beginning to hear a 'clicking' in my ears--the audio hallucinations have begun.</p><p>T+ 0:45-1:10>  I am noticing small, independently coloured dots in my field of vision, the movements of which corresponding to the rate and volume of the 'clicking' and the tingling sensation I feel when the dots seems to touch me.</p><p>T+ 1:11-1:30>  The 'clicking' is now turning into a seeminly pre-programmed chant of 'cackling'.  Also, the dots are now taking the form of faces resembling that of evil troll-like creatures.  The faces of the trolls are corresponding to the 'cackling' and everything seems to be covered in a dark shadow.  These shadows morph into people with a skull for a head, reaching for me; I would brush this off, however their 'touching' is beginning to correspond with the tingling sensation also.  I recognize these feeling from my previous T-2 uses, and fearing that it will progress too far I decide to walk to a friends house (who shall be known as L) for my safety.</p><p>T+2:00-13:00> I arrive at L's and tell him my situation, he agrees to make sure I don't harm myself during the trip.  I lie back looking at the ceiling when I begin to see very life-like images of the trolls from the corner of my eyes.  I work up the courage to turn my head to assure myself that it was only a hallucination, but when I look the image seems to become more real, the cackling nearly engulfs my hearing, and I begin to feel cold.  More trolls begin to appear and soon fill my entire vision.  Then it hits me, this shit is behaving like some sort of super-deleriant; at that time all the trolls jump at me and I begin to shout for help.  It's not that I think that they are actually there, but my body seems to react in a fearing way no matter how many times I tell myself that it's just a drug that tweaked with senses.  In order to stay sane, I decide to close my eyes; this way, I can further convince myself that all that is happening is not existing in my 'normal' reality, only in a 'Wow, this is a very realistic dream' condition.  The trolls then greet me with images of death and pain, and my body reacts by feeling cold (whenever they drown me), heat (whenever they burn me), or slight cramps (whenever they stab me).  (This cycle in contiuous throughout the trip.)  I then realize that I have to piss, which means that I will have to open my eyes and move through the cloud of evil.  I sit up and open my eyes and the room seems completely black.  Out of nowhere comes this being resembling an evil me.  I stare at it for a second, then it launches at me.  I begin to cramp in the places that it kicks and stabs me, so I leap to where L is and beg him to somehow put me to sleep.  I then ask if he could take me home so i can use my salvia--I figured that I would take 6 or 7 hits of the 10x extract and either knock myself unconscious or be totally within the salvia world, protected by my salvia guardians; however, at that moment, a troll seemed to grab me and suck out my brains.  It then proceeded to try to become one with me, only with the intent of taking over my body.  I denied it, so it choked me.  I could feel a coldest around my throat, so I retreated to a couch and layed on my hands, as to prevent me from causing harm or myself or L.  They always seemed to kill me in the same order--drowning, burning, stabbing, and eating.  All senses still corresponded to their actions.  At about 8:30pm, I could no longer see the trolls and the cackling subsided to the clicking.</p><p>This was the most senselessly frightening event of my life.  If I had seen other bad visions, or even if the trolls did something other than the pre-programmed routine, I would consider trying this drug again.  But this is the third time that I used this drug, and each time gave me exactly the same results (I think that the emotional and mental boost of T-7 on the previous trips was the only reason why I didn't freak out those times).  I tried to understand why they were behaving in such a way--maybe they were tortured souls themselves and saw me as a way to explore my reality, or maybe it may have been them showing the evil within me--these reasons don't explain thir attitudes nor my consistant trip experiences.</p><p>2/4-  At 1am I return to my house to flush the chemical down the toilet.  I will not touch this chemical for at least another year, maybe trolls will have a new routine, for although I have a very strong dislike for it, I did learn some invaluable trip survival and sitter skills.</p><p>I am not dicouraging the use of this chemical, chances are very likely you won't have a bad experience, but always be prepared for anything and use a sitter.</p>",
