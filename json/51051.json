 "report": "<p>Just for some context: I have a fairly extensive history of drug experimentation, including many hallucinogens.</p><p>I had drunk about seven drinks over the course of a couple hours when someone at a party I was at handed me two 5 mg pills of Ambien.  I had only ever taken 2.5 mg of Ambien at a time for sleep, often less, and had felt its effects to be interesting.  That said I never had had any interest in abusing them until this drunken moment.</p><p>It was already getting late; probably around one oclock in the morning.  I hadnt slept well the night before, and I was likely only awake because of the 200 mg caffeine pill I had ingested earlier that night.  For whatever reason, to me, it was exactly the moment to mess with some sleeping pills.  I rushed back to my room with a friend of mine and crushed one up.  Previously, I had only ever taken the pills orally, and even then they came on quickly.  Yet for some reason I wanted to snort them tonight.  I arranged the powder in a line and blew it into my left nostril.  There was a pause and then WHAM!</p><p>and then I blacked out.</p><p>Its not as if I lost all my memory.  I have bits and pieces.  The rest of this story is a synthesis of what I remember and what people informed me of the day later.</p><p>After snorting the pill, I sat down and started talking with my friend, Andy.  I had lost all motor function and I was hallucinating heavily.  The world possessed an eerie, ethereal quality.  I tried to converse with Andy but was blacking out so acutely; on such a short time scale, that I repeated myself over and over, asking him, Hows it going? around ten times.  After ten minutes he had had enough and as my roommate entered the room, he left.</p><p>My roommate could immediately tell I was completely obliterated.  I told him I wanted to take my other Ambien, which I did in a strange, slow, drunken manner.  Seven drinks is enough to make me pretty drunk and the first pill had increased my inebriation several-fold.  Somehow managing to organize the contents of the pill into lines and blow them up my right nostril I informed him I was now off to our resident hipster not-frat house. He tried to convince me not to.  The house was on the other side of campus and there were blizzard conditions outside.  Coming up on even more Ambien, I wouldnt hear of it, so he had to let me go.  I wasnt violent, belligerent, or mean, just dead set on that course of action.  It took me thirty minutes to get ready to leave.</p><p>Hunter S. Thomson speaks of ether as the king of depravity.  I wonder what his feelings on the combination of Ambien and alcohol would have been.  My motor function had left me completely; I lurched from side to side bouncing off walls.  I saw people and things not there.  Similarly I ignored many very real objects and people.  Gravity was no longer a predictable force.  Straight lines and right angles bent, breathed and warped chaotically.  About fifteen minutes later I had progressed about a tenth of the distance required and had not even left the building.</p><p>Suddenly two drunken friends came into view.  Together we entered a drowsing friends room, and demanded more Ambien.  She sleepily gave us four pills.  Easily distracted by more drugs, together we sloppily returned to my room.  More Ambien was insufflated.  Did I do any? At this point I couldnt tell you.  No one remembers much of this part of the night except that it happened and that all the pills were consumed.  My room was a complete mess at the end of the night if that elucidates anything.</p><p>At some point I found myself at the frat house.  I had made it there in driving wind with rising snow already above my ankles.  I was no longer with my friends, who had essentially broken into a different house and were depravedly conducting themselves.  I hung out there for hours, generally being extremely fucked up and embarrassing myself until, fed up, they called for the campus Safe Ride to take me back to my dorm. </p><p>Having slept about 5 hours in total that night, I awoke extremely well-rested, and as aforementioned, completely unaware of most of the evenings events.  In retrospect, the experience was very scary.  I only have the vaguest notion of how much of the drug I took, perhaps as much as 20 mg, snorted.  The combination of two powerful depressants laid waste to my motor function.  I was lucky in that a) I am a guy and not really at risk for rape b) I managed to get away without a dangerous overdose and c) I have good friends who were fantastic enough to take turns making sure I didnt kill myself by getting in a car or deciding to take a nap in the accumulating ice and snow.  Stuff not worth describing has fallen through the cracks.  I was extremely open and divulged a lot of very personal stuff to people I otherwise would not have.  When I heard what I had done I was mortified.  The amnesia that accompanied the drug made any and all of the fun I was clearly having completely irrelevant.</p><p>It very much scares me that I could have taken pill after pill without realizing what I was doing to myself.  I was not in my right mind while on it, and I feel completely depraved from my experience.  Snorting that first pill goes down as one of the worst decisions I have made.</p>",
