 "report": "<p>A little background on myself and drug history b4 we get started.  I have had experience with essentially all the common street drugs excluding crack and heroin, favoring high grade marijuana and psychedelics.  Kratom was a drug that I decided to try out of boredom really.  I have gradually tried to experiement with all of the 'legal highs' ever since I first tried salvia and discovered there was such a thing. </p><p>My motivation for this report is to shed some light on kratoms positive qualities as many of the reports I had initially read prior to trying kratom myself were negative and made it sound like heroin, with all the tales of addiction and withdrawls.  I have found that kratom may be that perfect high that can relieve the stress of the day while not negatively affecting my productivity or quality of life. </p><p>I have used kratom in both the powdered extract and dried leaf form.  I first preferred the extracts simply for the lack of effort or time required to get to the point, however, after trying a 'premium' dried leaf product changed my mind.  The leaf is boiled for a minimum 30 mins and drank.  It is somewhat bitter but I have grown to like it.  The tea also has a numbing quality to the tongue.  I have experiemented with sweetenting the tea or adding different flavors, even chammomile, but nothing covers the bitterness and it actually just makes it taste nasty.</p><p>Typical use for me will be in the late evenings.  I have found that the kratom buzz eases all the stress of the day for me.  Marijuana has a tendency to increase anxiety at times when a person is under extreme stress, kratom always eases my mind.  The great thing about kratom is that it also energizes the body without causing any jittery, caffiene like buzz.  When I take kratom before I exercise it works great.  I find that it allows me to zone out into my workout and go for a longer period of time.  If I just want to zone out and relax it works great for that as well.  In high doses a very itchy. opiate like, body buzz is felt.  I enjoy taking it and zoning out while laying in bed.  It would be great for meditation as I have found myself in many waking dreams after using large quantities.</p><p>There is another great use I have found for kratom that I haven't heard many speak of....using kratom to come down off of coke, mdma, lsd, etc.  Kratom, for me, has been the perfect drug to use to ease a comedown.  It is strong enough to overpower the effect of most other drugs if I take enough.  No more laying in bed wishing I could just shut my mind off.  Kratom eases my internal dialogue and allows me to rest (even if I don't sleep!)</p><p>In summary I have found kratom to be a wonder drug with no real side affects.  I have been using it for almost 2 years on and off and have been able to quit whenever I want for as long as I want.  Now I don't think I WANT to.  Why?  It keeps me from seeking out other highs with more side affects.  One last thing to note, I recently had some vicodin (60mg in 7 hours, a very high dose) and found the high much less desireable.</p>",
