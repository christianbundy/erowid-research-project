 "report": "<p>My very first experience thus far with Calea zacatechichi has been a farce where dreams are concerned. I did acquire the 10x extract reduced with distilled water. I placed a small amount in a pipe bowl on top of some fine cannabis and toked. Reminded me some-what of the way salvia feels on my skin, with the tiny pricks and the subtle thin film like feeling of something on your skin. A slight head change, not much more then other strange herbs not cannabis. Was some-what apprehensive about what to expect. Waited a half hour, read about how quantum physics says in some science mag that we may be holograms. I also fell asleep listening to an OM CD. I from 1 am to 6 am had no dream recall, much less vivid or lucid dreams. I went and had a larger toke the same way with more Dream herb 10x extract at 6 am. Nothing notable happened. I feel a bit more subtly aware at some level, but I'm not sure it not at some cost elsewhere, very subtle, and so much so you may miss it.</p><p>Don't plan to just throw in the towel, but for a first time experience it didn't really seem to fit the bill...</p><p>Inuic...</p>",
