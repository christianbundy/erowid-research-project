 "report": "<p>When I was sick as a child, which was a rather frequent occurrence, my mother used to give me codeine cough syrup.  It was a deep burgundy red and delicious-tasting, although it never seemed to do much for my cough. </p><p>Years later, when I got into drugs as a teenager (mostly weed), I began to experiment very occasionally with using the codeine cough syrup to get high.  In college, I began to use other drugs such as LSD and mushrooms, and became a more or less daily pot smoker.  I had a supply of codeine cough syrup (from home) but rarely if ever used it... until a couple of years after college when I went through a period of six months unemployment, at which time I rediscovered (or perhaps discovered for the first time) the joys of codeine.</p><p>I developed a certain discipline for maximizing the high, which entailed drinking a quart bottle of beer on a more-or-less empty stomach, and then ingesting four or five tablespoons of the syrup.  This produced a very pleasant opiate-type high, affecting both mind and body.  Fifteen to 20 minutes after ingestion, a deep feeling of relaxation and all-over warmth and peace ensues.  It is very sweet.</p><p>I tend to be a highly anxious and worried individual, but there are no worries on codeine; the worries are chilled right out of my bones on a wave of gentle euphoria.  The high lasts about two hours overall, with a peak period of about 30 to 45 minutes.  The one notable side effect is a mild itchiness that comes on with the buzz, lasts the duration of the high, and then goes away.  But when I'm high, the itch is not really a bother.  It's rather pleasant, in fact, to scratch the itch, while my stoned mind is dwelling on other things.</p><p>It should be noted that the stuff is both psychologically and physically addictive, in a low-grade sort of way.</p><p>Psychologically, one is always craving the high, the altered state, which is more pleasant than reality.  Physically, if I take it on a regular basis, I get mild withdrawal symptoms in the nature of a vague bodily dis-ease that is relieved only when I take the drug.  I found I could only get one 'good' high per day; any attempt to do more than that was a waste of the drug.  Because I loved the high so much, and wanted to maximize it, I used it somewhat parsimoniously, i.e., only once a day.  Fortunately, I think, my supply ran out following that six-month period when I was using regularly.  Thus, I never really had a chance to get 'hooked' in a serious way.  But I really loved that stuff while it lasted, and I do believe I was hooked on it in a mild sort of way, and it was a definitely drag to stop using it.</p><p>On two occasions, I experienced a scary side of codeine.</p><p>Once, I went through my standard ritual of fasting for several hours, drinking a quart of beer, and then ingesting codeine.  Then I went to a coffee shop with a friend and had a full, heavy meal (steak and french fries).  Halfway through the meal, I started feeling very strange.  I broke out in a cold sweat, and felt very lightheaded and flushed in my face.  My field of vision became blurry on the sides and seemed to telescope.  I could barely talk, and it was hard to breathe.  Feeling very ill, I had to lay down in the booth, and almost passed out.  My friend called an ambulance.  By the time it arrived 20 mins. to half-an-hour later, I had basically recovered.  The nasty paramedic asked me if I had been taking any drugs, which I denied.  He gave me a brief check-up, and left.  Although no harm was done, it was scary.</p><p>I felt like Mr. D had tapped me on the shoulder with his cold, bony fingertip.</p><p>Following this incident, I laid off the drug for a time.  When I began to use it again, I always took care to have some food in my stomach, and never again experienced those symptoms.</p><p>Another time, I offered some to a friend, who was intrigued by my stories of what a pleasant buzz it was.</p><p>He drank the syrup in the back of the car one night when we were out partying, and after a few minutes went into a semi-coma of the type I had experienced in the restaurant.  He couldn't talk, and was on the verge of passing out.  I was really worried; he looked like death warmed over.  But he recovered after about 20 minutes, and after that was fine (though he never wanted to do codeine again).</p><p>I haven't done the drug in years.  I am still worried and anxious.</p>",
