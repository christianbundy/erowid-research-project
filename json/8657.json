  "I purchase 3 hits of DOI against the advice of my dealer, who says its best to take only 1 hit. He said it would last 16 hours, and I laughed thinking, 'This hippy is trying to talk it up'. I ingest 3 hits and go to a drum circle.",

  "No effects",

  "Slight Euphoria, but the 'feeling' came to me, the feeling I gets when I know tripping shall occur",
  "T+3:00-4:00",
  "Heavy Euphoria, body high.. I ride in a car home from the gathering, and it is fantastic... I arrive back to my house, there I contemplate the meaning of 16 hours... for some reason I believe him now.. and it begins...Im very freaked out because I am staying with my parents and I dont have a car at the time.. no where to go, nothing to do... I try to sleep. Nothing. I get more and more freaked out and now every time I close my eyes I hear terrible quality reggaeton music and see various images of skulls, fire, and other such demonic things. Then I quit trying to sleep.",
  "T+4:00-6:00",
  "I watch Curly Sue with a renewed interest. It was fantastic, wonderful, excellent. Haha. I laughed and rejoiced.",
  "T+7:00-8:00",
  "I foolishly try to trick my self into sleeping and all of the aforementioned symptoms occur again. In the same intensity.",
  "T+8:00-10:00",
  "I watch Father of the Bride and it likewise was seeming one of the best movies ever.",
  "T+10:00-16:00",
  "I try to sleep, now I cant really express to sort of hell Im experiencing now, all of the same things but I try to battle them. I try to pray and when I pray I see with closed eyes arrows shooting out into oblivion and exploding. I want to cry but I dont. I just keep going through the same things. Ill have moments of peace soon after I convince myself that God will put me to sleep, little did I know, he certainly wouldnt.",
  "T+16:00-20:00",
  "I feel bad, like I had a bad trip all night and didnt sleep. I watch TV and try to eat, which isnt pleasant.",
  "The next day, I feel like crap and my eyes are dilated, this doesnt end for 2 days.",
  "Overall, it sucked and I wouldnt do it again, and I am not an inexperienced Psychonaut either, I dont know what it was that happened to make me think like I did, but I just wouldnt do it again."
