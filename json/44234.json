 "report": "<p>Back in February I had some very interesting and insightful experiences with 4Ho-DiPT.  I had purchased a couple hundred mg's and decided to try it out the night I received it.  In the name of safety, I measured out 15mg which I thought would be a good dosage to start with.  I could feel slight effects beginning after 15 minutes.  The high itself came on extremely dreamlike, and had peaked at 1 hour, resulting in a brief 15-20 minute period in which the body load was extremely intense.  Overall this first trial was mildly psychedelic, with the reasonably intense effects lasting for only a short time.  I figured I merely massively underdosed and planned another experiment for several days after that to allow any tolerance gained to the drug to subside.</p><p>On this attempt I decided to double the dosage in order to acheive what I assumed to be full effects.  I weighed out the 30mg and dumped the bitter chemical on my tounge.  Slight effects were noticed by T+0:10, and I figured that a bowl of weed would help amplify the initial effects.  Seeing as how I was'nt quite sure what exactly I was going to experience with this high I sat and waited for the experience to mount.  By 45min into it I was getting uncomfortable (not in any way painful) and undesired 'leg tremors' (as Shulgin refers to them as).  I figured the best way to ease the tremors would be to lay down to reduce any weight/pressure on my legs.</p><p>I put on some pink floyd to listen to while the pretty intense experience hit me.  Before I knew it I was catapulted into a black space, clinging onto every note of the floyd in a very far out cosmic way, afterall, this was the cosmic egg.  I found this seemingly inherient state to be incredibly fascinating, although not as intense as one would imagine.  This complete perspective shift allowed me to think on a level that was far greater than myself as an induvidual, and left me in absolute wonder.  While the visuals werent strong like an LSD trip, the cosmic vibes were the same, maybe even more internalized due to the lack of the visual component.  I could almost see entire lifetimes occur through other people's eyes in a blurry almost infantile perspective.  I floated through space, sometimes realizing there was neither an up or down, merely an all encompassing void.  I'm not quite sure if this experience could have even been possible without the floyd, they synergized impecibly. It seemed almost as if it were entirely new music, although I'd heard the albums dozens of times before.  This experience quickly subsided at T+3:45 and I almost immediately fell asleep and woke up the next day feeling rested and no hangover effects. </p><p>I took the chemical 4 more times after this one, each time intending to match up to the first one.  The second time I dosed 30mg and got basically the same effects to the first time, I even shoveled another 15mg into my mouth at T+1:45.  Surprisingly I found this to neither increase the intensity of the trip nor the duration, I'm assuming it has some sort of rapid tolerance build up like LSD or Psilocybin.  This experience was almost identical to the first lasting approximately 4 hours with a rapid come down followed by restful sleep.</p><p>The next time I ingested the drug it was basically identical to the two experiences listed above, only ingesting a 40mg quantity at once.  This came on relatively rapidly, and by T+0:25 I was starting to feel the effects nicely. The plateau lasted for 3 1/2 hours and I was'nt able to go to sleep with as much ease as in  the prior experiences, the after effects lasting another 3 hours until I was finally able to sleep.</p><p>The last and final time I took it I dosed 35mg and felt it come on just as before, except that the cosmic egg had lost its zeal.  I had overused the drug at high dosages and could litterally see through the cosmic egg that perplexed me in the 3 previous times.  After this I decided to discontinue any further experimentation with the drug, due to the fact that future explorations COULD pose some sort of health risk. </p><p>Overall I would describe my 4Ho-DiPT experiences as incredible +3-3.5 experiences that are by far some of my most valuable psychedelic experiences.  I think that with guided closed eye exercises I could find this to be an extremely fun and mystifying journey through the cosmos.  The key is to redirect the intense body load the drug creates.  I hope this answered some questions any potential users of this drug may have had, it is relatively benign for an RC but should still be taken seriously.  Peace.</p>",
