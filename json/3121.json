 "report": [
  "I was at the warm fuzzy champagne (quite) drunk stage at a new year's party.  And a little elf came by and suddenly I was saying 'okay sure' to trying some of this stuff.  I don't remember how the conversation started and at the time I had no clue as to what this stuff was except that it was a psychedelic.  Usually I'm very cautious about new drug experiences -- especially psychedelics, but turns out there's a world of difference between saying 'no' when sober and saying 'no' on glasses of good champagne.",
  "I think I was given 15mg at most -- 'a small dose' said the elf.  I drank it in a small gulp.  Tasted bitter.  I am usually rather sensitive to any psychedelic, physically as well as mentally.  I can really enjoy them, but as I get older, I tend to be more brittle and anxious if I get higher than I like.  But I guess due to my happy drunkenness and the elf talking calmly of small doses and no big deal, I had no pre-trip anxieties.",
  "I felt the effects start pretty quickly -- nothing there but champagne to stop them but it came on slowly in a non-threatening way like the beginnings of a happy acid trip. I think I was surprised when it just kept climbing.  I had not prepared for anything but a mild experience. There was someone at my elbow who I had been speaking to in a friendly way all night who I realized had also decided to try this stuff.  I suddenly felt that it might be good if we both went off to sit down and figure out how we were feeling.  Now I'm not sure if he felt that need -- but he came along amiably enough.",
  "We ended up in another room where two people were sitting quietly -- much less noise and activity than the original area, and settled on the futon.  I immediately felt more comfortable though I had not felt exactly anxious before.  Just the beginnings of 'gee this is going to be heavier than I though, maybe I should take stock'.",
  "I'm writing this a couple days later so I have more of a sense of over-view than a memory of each step of the trip.  I felt a some anxiety partly based on the normal mental scatterdness of the psychedelic experience but more due, I think to the somewhat overwhelming physical reactions.  I always feel like a react more strongly physically to drugs than my friends a lot of the time, but my 'partner' also mentioned that he felt rather physically overwhelmed.  I felt that I didn't want to move -- rather like that leaden pot feeling but stronger, like I was pinned to the futon.  I'm not sure how much time it took to get to this state -- one minute i was walking from another room getting kind of high, then i was on the futon discussing it, then I was pinned to the mattress.  On the other hand, the mattress felt rather comfy.  At some point I was getting waves of vibrating shivers going up and down my body.  My teeth were actually chattering. but I wasn't cold.  I also experienced some dry-mouth. ",
  "My trip partner said later that he had much enjoyed the feel of the coat i was wearing -- a delightful long-haired poofy thing.  So I think, though this substance effects one strongly physically, there's a positive buzz as well as the heaviness.  I also have to take into account the fact that i was way drunk when i took it.  I've never tripped drunk before.",
  "At the peak of the 'pinned down' phase, the oev were incredible.  the futon was part of a loft (underneath) so I had wooden slats with strong wood grain patterns including eyes overhead. The whole thing was shimmering and dripping in a really fun way.  Usually, for me, psychedelic visuals that intense are also blurred and disconcerting, like the wrong glasses prescription.  This was clear and surprisingly un disturbing.  I could actually enjoy it rather than freak out that the world was melting.  Or at least in waves I could.  Sometimes the thing would get a bit intense physically and my heart would race and I'd prop myself on my elbow and talk about it.  That would calm me down and I'd let go again and drift in and out.  Unlike most super-intense psychedelic experiences I've had, I was able to let go with the 4-acO-det and enjoy it in waves without feeling that my brain might dissolve into madness.",
  "I think the peak was mercifully short too.  Just enough to say 'weee, that wasn't so bad' and still feel like it kicked my ass hard enough to say 'woah, I think I had a good new year's eve.'",
  "As I remember, my conversation was very often about how I was feeling about the drug -- this kept me calm.  I was also in a non-introspective mood to begin with -- I also had never met the person I was speaking to before that evening so I was in 'acquaintance' mode, though feeling quite comfortable with it.",
  "I felt like I had come off a merry-go-round ride when I was done.  Disarranged and breathless and giggling a little. Oh and a bit funny in the tummy which resolved itself into a crampy knot -- no worse and not as bad as lsd or mushrooms have effected me.  And that's saying something considering all the champagne in my stomach. For such an intense experience, at the time, I thought it had been surprisingly clear-headed mentally.  On the other hand I don't remember much of it in detail.  On the other hand, I was drunk.",
  "I'd say all in all a fun experience, but I wouldn't do it to be social -- too intense, too short for a psychedelic. MDMA is so social that 4 hours is enough, but for psychedelics, I like more time to hang out and get friendly. And since that's usually why I do anything chemical these days I think that's my last experience with 4-ocetoxy-det, but we part very amicably."
