 "report": "<p>Quite a while back, I had gotten surgery on an ingrown toenail and the doctor prescribed Vicodin 5/500 for the pain.  I never needed it, so I saved them (16 of them) for later on.  Now I'm very glad I did :)  A few weeks ago, I experienced opioids for the first time.  I wanted to try it the night before I ended up using it, but didn't because I was very stressed out at the time, and realized a responsible drug user does not use drugs to escape stress.  Luckily, the next day, all of my problems were resolved and the stress was gone.  I had not been taking any OTC drugs or herbal supplements.  I was clean.  I decided this night would be quite an ideal night to use it, as it would only add to my already positive state of mind.  I prepared for the experience by not eating for 6 hours before, so the effects would be more intense.  I sat down on my sofa and turned on the TV.  I took 3 pills out of my bottle.  I broke each pill in half.  At 10:15 I swallowed all the halves.  I laid down and waited for the effects to come on. </p><p>By 10:40 I was feeling euphoric, a little numb, and a bit uncoordinated.  My pupils were very constricted and my thinking was very clear.  Later that night, my friend Nicole called me on the phone.  I stumbled over to phone and answered it.  I laid back on my sofa and we talked on the phone for hours.  My speech wasn't slurred or anything, so she never knew I was on hydrocodone, but I could tell it made a real difference.  I felt more friendly and sociable.  We also had some very meaningful chat about the future of our lives, and too many other things to remember.  There wasn't a quiet moment.  I talked openly with her about our friendship and we talked about what we like about each other and what bothers us.  I apologized to her for every mean thing I've every done.  I felt very peaceful, loving, and happy.  Nothing made me upset.  I didn't get offended at anything.  I learned what a great, deep, kind, socially outgoing person I have the potential to be. </p><p>I had one of best nights of my life, staying at home and talking on the telephone.  By the time she had to go, I had come down and was quite tired.  I went to sleep very easily and woke up the next day feeling very well rested and had no hangover or anything.  I would love to feel like that all the time, but know that would definitely not be a good idea, so I'm saving the rest for a special occasion.  My drug past is: cannabis, salvia divinorum, N2O, DXM, Hydrocodone.  Of all the drugs I've tried, Hydrocodone is the best.  It puts the others to shame.  I love the way it makes you feel wonderful, but you still keep a very firm grip on reality.  I highly recommend trying it, but only if you control yourself.  It is addictive, so only occasional use is a good idea.  And, if you're going to take 8 or more at one time, it is very important that you extract the acetaminophen first.  Doses this high (of APAP) could cause liver damage.  Enjoy and use responsibly!</p>",
