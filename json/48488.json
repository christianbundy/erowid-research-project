 "report": "</p>[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</p><p>This was my first time using 2C-T-7. I recreationally smoke marijuana, and have taken psychedelic mushrooms on many an occasion, with most trips being relatively non-intense and with my last two experiences, being of an unknown golden-top variety, leading to two relatively intense and disturbing trips. I have also occasionally taken other non-hallucinogenic substances like speed.</p><p>Weeks prior to taking the 2C-T-7 I had been at a friend's party where I had seen what can only be described as an orgy of drug crazed freaks. They were an interesting breed, seeming much more anxious than average 'shroom head' and yet more detached than any LSD crazies that I had previously encountered. One man, who would end up being our supplier, was sitting on his bed screaming 'ON, OFF' at the lights. He couldn't decide which he preferred. Who could blame him, I was later to learn that while under the effects of 2C-T-7 such decisions almost become impossible.</p><p>After observing the mayhem at the party, my friend J. and myself - being the type that would try anything at least once, decided that it looked like a wild trip and acquired some.</p><p>About a week or two later - my memory has blurred a little since the event, myself and my friend J., while at a small gathering after a weekly pub crawl, decided to take the drug. I didn't know any of the people at the house very well, except for one girl who was for the most part passed out in the corner of the lounge room and a friend who was to leave as soon as we had taken the drug - he had predicted the scene's deterioration. Before I knew it one thing had lead to another and J., a girl I had only just met, the owner of the abode, who appeared to know a lot about the drug, and myself were sitting on the stained carpet floor snorting roughly 15 mg of 2C-T-7 each.</p><p>At first we just sat around talking. I wasn't that anxious but I have always been wary of synthetic drugs, especially when snorted. Soon, as I had foreseen, my nose began to burn. But then after about five minutes something that I hadn't experienced when taking any other hallucinogens happened, the sickness set in. My stomach felt as though it was eating itself and I was engulfed in a wave of nausea.</p><p>J. seemed distressed, he began asking the owner of the abode a million and one questions. I was beginning to worry that they would think that we were narcs. This paranoia was only heightened by the appearance of cat shit throughout the house. Something I quickly made a note of and then realised how offensive I might have come across to the owner. This would be a continuing theme of the night. Constantly making note of the dilapidated state of his house and then realising that he lives there. However the cat shit was overwhelming, I kept on looking around to make sure I hadn't sat on it, without trying to look too obvious.</p><p>To lighten the mood I tried to ask the owner about the amazing drawings on the wall, that by now were taking on new forms. About 15 minutes into the trip my stomach had settled a little and the hallucinations were coming on strong. I have had a common hallucination through a lot of my trips recently, especially when I look at carpets. Of course it is hard to explain when not on drugs and even harder while under the effects of drugs. But all I can think of is the back of playing cards, the spiraled, intertwining, geometric patterns crossing over one another. The deeper I looked into the carpet the more layers I discovered. Truly amazing.</p><p>It was at this point that the girl who I didn't know interrupted my thoughts by asking me something that has long since morphed into unconsciousness. I remember thinking of her as a bit of a drifter and therefore I launched into a diatribe about the similarity of all situations. I used this experience of talking to her in the kitchen as an example and told her that 'we could be anywhere in the world and could still have the same conversation'. Something as pathetic as that anyway. She seemed impressed and so I pushed the point further. Soon the conversation was in full flow and everything else in the room began to blur. The intensity of the conversation heightened and for one reason or another I felt a bulge in my pants. It wasn't as though I was attracted to the girl, far from it, but I guess it was just one of those odd connections that we have from time to time.</p><p>Suddenly the music - that I had only been subconsciously aware of, stopped and the girl and myself were thrown back into the reality of the room. J. was still complaining about his stomach and made a break for the bathroom. He seemed to be gone for a long period of time. In the mean time I acquainted myself with the green couch. It was truly fascinating, like the carpet insane layers of pattern moved over one another in motions that I would never truly be able to understand. I felt as though I was about to be consumed by the intoxicating vibrations of the couch, when suddenly J. reappeared. He looked flustered and I shuddered to think of what he had been up to in the toilet.</p><p>The lack of music was becoming a problem and so I offered to retrieve a CD from my car, the girl that I had been talking to earlier decided to come with me. I knew this was a mistake as I was beginning to expect that she wanted something that I wasn't quite prepared for in my state. Nevertheless we both went to the car. Once I had figured out how to open the door I began my search for the CD. This proved futile. The girl then began to tell me about how she had never driven a car and really wanted to learn.</p><p>For on reason or another, probably because I feared her coming onto me, I let her jump in the driver's seat and start up the car. I got into the passenger's seat, said a quick prayer - being an atheist and under the effects of the drug I wasn't too sure what to say, and fastened my seat belt. I sat there for a moment before realising that she didn't even know how to turn it on. I looked at her blankly, she stared back at me, I looked at the keys in her hand and my pants began to bulge once more. I quickly shook this feeling and grabbed the keys from her hand, instructed her to put the keys in the ignition and make the necessary arrangements. She did so obediently. The car started and I talked her through bringing the clutch up and accelerating slowly.</p><p>Unfortunately the car was parked on muddy grass, on a hill. Not an easy start for the most experienced of drivers, little own someone one on a head full of 2C-T-7 who had never even sat in the driver's seat before. Suddenly the car launched forward, she turned frantically and we swung into the curb on the opposite side of the road. I was naturally a little jolted and a little abuse was exchanged. After a few moments of inner contemplation I calmed down and we set off again.</p><p>We were now at least an hour into our trip, I think that the excitement suppressed any further intense hallucinations as we crazily drove around the back streets of suburbia. The driving lesson lasted for at least an hour, towards the end as early morning joggers were venturing out onto the streets we twice nearly ran someone over. At some point we became so lost that I made her stop the car while I searched for the street directory, this became an entirely new adventure. Climbing around the car, diving under seats, whilst avoiding her seductive eye.</p><p>Eventually we made it back to the house to learn that J. was long since gone. I was a little worried about him, but much more relieved that I had survived this horrific experience with the girl. We sat around the house for a little while feeling obviously awkward. Eventually I realised that it was time to go - the owner was dropping his friend at work, and so I offered to give the girl a lift home. The entire way she babbled crazy talk. I felt as though I was beginning to come down and happily tuned out to her monotonous dribble.</p><p>After ridding myself of the girl I faced a long drive home along the freeway. Besides intense internalised thought that at times made me think that I was losing all touch with reality, the ride home was uneventful.</p><p>Unfortunately when I arrived home craving bed I was reminded that I was meant to be helping my family move house. I am sure that I had taken note of this important factor earlier in the night, but for one reason or another I had chosen to ignore it's importance. So I spent the next three hours feeling like I was going to die as I moved furniture around the place. A truly horrible end to a horrific and yet interesting night.</p><p>I am yet to try 2C-T-7 again. I think that I would definitely prefer to do it in safe surroundings next time, although most of my trips always seem to be spontaneous and end up with many a near death experience. However I will definitely never allow myself to be near a car again. Life is far too short for such stupid risks.</p>",
