 "report": "<p>Having read a lot about blue lotus, we decided we had to at least try it before it got banned.  We purchased a quantity of dried petals online.</p><p>Pharmacokinetics</p><p>I am 65kg, female, 27y, with a fast metabolism</p><p>My co-conspirator is 75kg, male, 28y, and similar.</p><p>7g of blue lotus petals each</p><p>Extraction</p><p>Since we didn't want to eat the quite large amount of plant material, and suspecting the active ingredient to be a water-soluble alkaloid, we placed the petals into microfibre infusion pouches- like fill-it-yourself teabags-  and dropped them into 400ml of tap water that was just off the boil.  We dunked and squashed the pouches with a stirrer and kept the temperature around 95 deg C with further low heat in order to keep the infusion going for twelve to fifteen minutes.</p><p>We strained the infusion through muslin into a glass container.  We then used the muslin to squeeze as much fluid from the pouches as possible.</p><p>The result was about 320ml of dark brown, slightly gritty solution.  We split it in two and placed it in glasses.  We drank it, my friend downed it in one hit and I sipped at it.  It was intensely bitter and made me feel nauseous-  though I do not believe this to be a pharma effect, rather that it just tastes nasty.</p><p>This was T+0:00</p><p>We then smoked a joint of cannabis and drank 120ml of 40% vodka each over about an hour.</p><p>At T+0:15, I felt the muscles of my face relax and experienced a bump.</p><p>At T+1:00 I started to experience serotonergic rushes. Colors became slightly more intense and the neon lights in the middle distance looked really sharp.</p><p>At T+1:30, we smoked another joint.  We both felt very relaxed and the slight visual effects were a little more pronounced.</p><p>At T+2:00, I was well under the influence and I tickled my friend.  He felt it kick off at that point.  We speculate that the blue lotus makes the brain more eager to produce serotonin, but does not itself stimulate production directly. </p><p>At T+2:30, we were both regularly feeling rushing, and my friend determined that the effect was closely modulated by alcohol-  it only took a couple of minutes after swallowing a little vodka for another rush to come in.  We both felt very friendly and extremely social.  My mind did not feel dulled by the various drugs, and I was very able to converse in a social way,  however I noticed that my higher reasoning was somewhat impaired.  We were hacking at my new Mac and we couldn't really work things out as well as we normally could.  Speech was also somewhat affected,  not slurring, but I suffered some nominative dyspraxia (I couldn't always think of the names for things, though I still knew what they were.)  I also stuttered more than I usually do.  My friend says he sometimes found himself saying the wrong words, though I don't remember this.  By this time we were listening to music and finding our moods were very closely influenced by the songs.  It was very pleasant.</p><p>T+3:00, we were coming down a little, and it was very late at night, so we split a can of Red Bull and added a little more vodka (~100ml vodka each).  This contained about 75mg caffeine for each of us.  This turned out to be somewhat of a mistake,  I shortly felt quite overwhelmed.  Not nauseous, but very overstimulated.  Having my eyes open became disorienting and unpleasant, and I spent about the next 40 minutes curled in a fetal position with a duvet over me.  Fortunately, my friend is not easily freaked out, and as long as I kept telling him I felt okay, he was fine.  I felt quite happy and comfortable, as long as I kept my eyes closed.  I felt safe, and the high felt very clean and warm and friendly.  A few minutes later, my friend started to feel the same effect,  we speculate that the caffeine was too much at this point.</p><p>T+4:00, this had passed, we were still coasting along.  We watched some videos and were having a great time.</p><p>The effects gradually trickled away over about seven hours, and from this we estimate that the active ingredient in blue lotus has an elimination half life of about three to five hours.  We still notice some slight social effects and a mild high some eighteen hours later.  At no time did I feel that I was 'not myself', which markedly distinguishes this from a tryptophan effect,  they always make me feel quite 'un-self'.   My friend agrees,  this drug does not produce a feeling of 'otherness' like many drugs we have tried.</p><p>At 8am, we were feeling a bit tired and hungry, so we went to get something to eat.  We ate sandwiches and drank fruit juice, which brought the effects down to a very mellow level and then I went home to bed.  I felt just fine riding the tram home on my own,  I didn't feel that I was looking at all crazy, or fear that people were looking at me.  I just felt very normal.</p><p>Each time we added a little alcohol to the mix, we noticed a 'rush' come up,  these started quite gently, peaking at about T+3:00.  The difficulty of separating the effect of the blue lotus active ingredient concentration from the 'pushing' effect of the alcohol makes it difficult to draw a conclusion from this.</p><p>This drug is very strongly synergistic with alcohol, nicotine and cannabis (at least) and there is a risk of an overstimulation episode with injudicious use.  We both noticed that every time it felt like the drug had 'stopped working', we could kick it off again very easily and quickly with alcohol,  I stopped drinking alcohol for several hours after my overstimulation episode and the drug's effects quickly diminished.  When I sipped a little more, somewhat later, it came back just the same as before the overstimulation,  it was very pleasant and controllable, without the dizzying height of MDMA.  Really, the combination of alcohol and blue lotus felt like a really mild version of MDMA, without the methamphetamine buzzing and without the hyperactivity.  I was happy to sit wherever I was and listen and talk to people.  I felt very connected to my friend, and I opened up my computer to chat to people who weren't physically present.</p>",
