 "report": [
  "My story begins shortly after I'd run out of weed. In an attempt to ward off the withdrawals until I could re-supply, I began looking for natural, 'homemade' highs, and, to my great surprise, stumbled upon nutmeg. Yes, nutmeg, the cheap, available, and legal spice used in pies and cookies. Naturally, I had to try it out.",
  "Working off various accounts from the Internet, I decided to try a smaller dose to start, as I was both unsure of the effects and, incidently, it was all I had in the pantry. In total, I ingested approximately 2 tbsp. the first night, mixing the vile-tasting powder with milk. As it were, the pre-ground powder proved quite insoluble, and merely floated to the top, but I managed to choke it down.",
  "The result? A persistent headache, some minor visual distortion, and a distinct sense of disappointment. I experienced no euphoria or hallucinations of any kind, nor did I feel particularly sedated. The only good outcome of the experiment was a sense of peacefulness the next morning, which persisted till about noon. Fortunately, just as there was no 'nutmeg high', there was also no 'nutmeg hangover', and I felt normal again by the afternoon.",
  "Though disappointed, I had felt something that night, albeit weak, so I resolved to try again. Purchasing more pre-ground nutmeg, I again attempted to achieve a marijuana-like high. Here's the play-by-play:",
  "0:00  It's 5:00 pm, Thursday. I start slow, downing 1 tbsp. of nutmeg. This time, rather than trying to mix the powder with liquid, I merely downed 'hits' of nutmeg in half-tablespoon increments with juice (apple, then orange), a sip of juice, the powder, another sip, then swallow. Certainly not a method for the faint-hearted.",
  "1:00  Watching TV. The headache begins to return, 'nutmeg burps' start. No visual distortions yet, nor any particular sense of sedation or euphoria.",
  "2:00  It's now about 7:00 pm. Still feeling nothing aside from the headache, I ingest an additional 2 tbsp.",
  "3:00-8:00  Visual distortions begin. These take the form of a general 'fuzziness', similar to that experienced when binge drinking. Things objects take on a shimmering quality. My eyes begin to feel warm during this time, also, but only take on a pinkish hue rather than the full-blown redness associated with dope. I also begin to feel mildly sedated. During this time, I am at first working on digital images, then playing a rather slow-paced computer game, listening to music the entire time. None of these activities seem any more enjoyable than they usually would be.",
  "5:30  At this point, 10:30 pm, I decide that the dosage was insufficient, and take an addition  tbsp. This brings the total to 4 tbsp. since 5:00 pm. Nutmeg burps have since stopped, but begin again, briefly.",
  "8:00  From 1:00 to about 2:15 am, I decide to try watching TV, hoping for some evidence of a marijauna-like high. The various shows I watch are funny, but I find them only as funny as I would watching them sober.",
  "9:15  Dissappointed, I decide to go to bed. I listen to music at first, but find my persistent headache growing more intense, so I shut it off. I also feel somewhat nauseous now, something that hadn't occurred until that point.",
  "9:45  Now 2:45 am, something unexpected happens, my heart rate increases, and the nutmeg arguably 'kicks in'. The visual distortions, which could be described as a purplish, shimmering haze in the dark, begin to intensify, taking on a swirling, whirlpool-like aspect. My mind, which had been clear and unaffected to this point, begins racing, much like it would when smoking hippie-grass, but less intense. I feel a mild sense of panic at times, mainly due to concern over my increased heart rate, but these feelings are easily controlled by conscious effort. During this time, I also experience a number of 'waking dreams', each lasted from a few seconds to a few minutes before I snapped back to consciousness.",
  "10:30  It's now 3:30 am, and I, having waited a surprisingly swift 45 minutes since beginning to feel any significant effects from the nutmeg, decide that the sense of euphoria is not going to materialize, and so go to bed. I fall asleep within minutes.",
  "15:00-18:00  I manage about 4 hours of solid sleep before waking at around 8:00 am. After this, I sleep and wake somewhat fitfully until about 11:00 am, roused several times by dreams I can no longer remember.",
  "18:00  At about 11:00 am, I wake again, switching between disorientation and clarity, sleep and wakefulness for about an hour. My mouth is quite pasty during this time.",
  "19:00  Noon. Though I'm still tired, I decide I won't get any rest in my current disoriented state, so I elect to get up. My mind begins to clear once I start moving.",
  "Presently  It's now about 3:00 pm. I still have a mild headache (the one thing that's persisted throughout this experience), and my vision still has the shimmering-hazy quality to it, albeit less intense than last night. I don't have the same sense of peacefulness I did yesterday, I but I do feel a mild sense of 'detachment'. All of these feelings have been steadily diminishing since I got up.",
  "To conclude, I was quite disappointed with the results of this little experiment. It's clear that the dosage I took was insufficient for a person of my size and/or with my chemical tolerance. That said, I probably won't try it again, or at least not often, as I feel the risks of trying to find an effective-yet-tolerable dosage are too great. Plus, the taste is worse than death itself."
