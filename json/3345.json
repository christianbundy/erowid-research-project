 "report": [
  "Took 0.5 mg klonopin at 8pm (for the state of the union address). Very relaxed setting of my living room after a nice relaxing day. This is my first time taking any Benzodiazepines.",
  "I was prescribed this to help with my fear of flying. Since I am flying out again soon, I thought I would test it at home to see the effects before I got into the air. I have taken Vicodin for flying before and it just made me feel disconnected and anxious. I am hoping this will be something different.",
  "I took the same dosage last night and didnt feel too much of anything, except feeling like my legs were kinda weak. But tonight I was doing my college algebra homework and finally had to stop around 1:30 because the horniness and the concentration levels had shifted and 'inequality number lines' werent as much fun anymore.",
  "After about 2 hours, I felt relaxed and a bit calmer. Its different from Vicodin in that this isnt a sort of heady, thinking drug. Its more of a fuzzy-wuzzy drug. Just sort of rounds all the edges away from the sharp demands of a day. About 1am came the horniness. It wasnt so much as 'I need to be penetrated' horniness, but more of an 'all over awareness of my sexual being' feeling. Its about 2:40am now (6.5 hours since I took the clonazepam) and the fuzziness has increased and the horniness has increased as well. I have some dry mouth and some dry eyes, but other than that, not a single side effect. I have been able to moderately continue to type without too much problems. I have lost track of some thoughts halfway through them.",
  "Its hard to tell if the anxiety wore off after time on its own, or if it was the drug. At 3am, I dont feel any pressing anxiety. Still horny, still have sea legs and quickly getting very tired.",
  "This has been a good test to know that just 0.5mg isn't going to help with my future plane trip, but that it is much more calming then the Vicodin was. I didnt feel all that anxiety disappear as quickly as I would have liked for a plane ride. So I believe that the next trial will be with two pills, 1.0mg.",
  "If there are any last words about this, they are that it lasts a long time."
