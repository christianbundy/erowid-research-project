 "report": "<p>I decided to see TooL on May 16th this year in our capital city, Vienna. I saw them one time before, totally sober, on 'Rock im Park'-Festival in Nrnberg, juz playin for bout an hour, but the show was something like my first contact with my own body-originated-hallucinogens, and very hypnotic with the strobo and the overwhelming visualizations. I had 'ordered' 2-c-t-7, which is completely legal in Austria, but its not available here, because the substance isnt really infamous in this part of the world, thru a German friend. . . approx. 30mg. The tabs arrived, white colored, without printing. 1 tab was crushed, probably due to transport. So I dissolved the tabs in water, in the trains toilet, where I decided to down that ugly tasting stuff, sure it doesnt offend your tongue and gum like some fresh boiled cacti, but shroomz taste way better than T7, at least when the tabs are dissolved in water. I began to notice the first FX still being on the train to Vienna with my fellas (bout 10-12 people. . . 4 from my band LeAK). Ill give you a translation of my original notes, explanations in brackets]:</p><p>16.15: Ingestion of 28-30mg dimethoxy-N-propylthionphenethylamine (2-c-t-7) Good atmosphere (set+setting optimal)</p><p>17. 23h: I dont think the guy ripped me off, comes up very slow, mescaline was much faster. . . funny feeling (tingling?) in the (back)head. No optic shifts now, no nausea, no convulsions, thoughts['thought patterns'] get mellow(er), kinda pressure on my throat's main artery (->mescaline. . . )</p><p>18. 07h: First effects!;optical;3D:) ; [I remember standing in the train station hall, after some slight and short nausea(nearly not noticeable) and anoretic feelings, staring at the skycraper-high/deep? tiles on the ground, recognizing that the stuffs working pretty fine and Im gettin some serious optic, even if its not that overwhelming visual enhancement im used to from high mescaline doses. My thought patterns are very clear, I didnt smoke my super skunk on the train, like the others. The words 'mescaline light' flash into my mind and remembering me of the second time I had contact with the holy cactus, some expensive powder capsules from NL, giving me</p><p>a pleasant, chilly 'demo-version' of mescalitos world. Depth of hue is increased, everythings glowing, at least a lil bit, colours are rich and awesome. The metallic escalator gave me a whole mescaline spectrum of colours, this still happens with escalators, even if I'm sober. . . ]</p><p>18. 30: more FX, very mescaline related, thoughts still 'untouched'; I'm very euphoric 'inside'. [The FX got more intense, then dropping of for a while. . . due to adrenaline, because of the show, I was very excited, which is common for people suffering from ads/hyperactivity, and I still hoped that Meshuggah would do support. . . I lost the 'focus' for the trip, concentrating on the TooL show, but the trip should last for longer I'd ever have expected and come back after the show, as I soon will notice. . . Weve smoked sum skunk and I ate sum shroomz [bout 1g], cause our 'first guitar', Zoy, had some with him, tripping at least for the last hour, offering me the shroombaggy. . . Pablo, the support band was real crap and I hope theyll never play again on a stage, especially not as 'replacement' for Meshuggah, and 'support' for TooL. . . ]</p><p>23. 37h: Boah. concert was juz ingenious. trip wasn't very manifested on the show, except for: LATERALUS; CEV's en masse [I can't assume that's right. . . I had awesome CEV's the whole show, sum slight OEV's, colours were glowing, bright and shimmering, LOTS of energy and a very pleasant (->THC?) body load. But the definitive peak was LATERALUS, becoming one concentrated energy singularity, making a wide circle around me in the mosh pit, without shoving, juz pushing away the overloaded crowd, unbelievable energy streaming thru me, eyes closed, throat wide open and yelling out the colorful patterns into the fluid air, I was performing kinda cosmic ritual without even knowing, communicating with my activated kundalini, which is another story, realizing the plasmatic energy stream in my spine, giving me strength of 3-4 men(no exaggeration!), still successfully defending the perfect circle around me. I saw the core of myself, connected with the elementary core of the universe, a permanent fluorescent energetic stream/line consciousness within my souls shell gyrating and vibrating inside a complex powerful organic machine, pure insight. . . it was a very pleasant, glowing experience and totally unexpected from this subtle substance, not to mention it's completely indescribable. ]</p><p>The set list (not the correct order):</p><p>Ticks n Leeches (I think this really was the opener, after a tremendous drum solo. ) The Grudge; 4 Stinkfist Schizm Parabol/Parabola LATERALUS [break with Parabola video] TRIAD+Reflection Merkaba (???) Opiate;</p><p>[TooL had a good time on stage, at least thats what it looked like. . . the light was great, the visualizations even better and more compelling than the last time, the music was juz incredible. . . they played for bout 2 and a half hour, with the break and really kicked ass. . . probably I forgot sum songs in the electric heat of the show. . . TooL really was a hallucinogenic experience, even if I would have been sober . . . ]</p><p>after the concert: mescaline light; clear head; good optic; pure mescaline colours.</p><p>[I wrote sum kinda german 'poetic' (???) prosa, while 3 of my companions tried to sleep, I had to keep an eye open and my ears plugged into Aenima. . . you can try to translate, but I think youll have a hard time. . . I had pretty cool effects, getting more and more intense each hour I didnt sleep, instead smoking MJ;) The next day, I couldnt recognize a face more than 12 feet away, because of the heavy visual FX, colors glowing and blurring, tracers everywhere, dry eyes, extreme body load, slight convulsions and muscle jerks. . . I had no sleep for 42 hours, +24h tripping on T7 and heavy skunk. . . my energy level was still good, at least not that phucked up I expected. . . I could even do the rehearsal. . . all in all an unforgettable experience. conclusion:T7 is good stuff, Ill give it another try another time in a calm environment. . . ]</p><p>- 293</p><p>Zerronnen in den Strmen, geflutet von gleiender Wrme, erfllen</p><p>sich Wnsche aus alten Tagen, Visionen antiker Stdte auf</p><p>aztekischen Wnden und Bden verlaufen in Spiralen angewandter</p><p>Quantenphysik, tauchende, schwimmende, flieende Schemata bersten</p><p>am sumerischen Fels der Mauern, sinkend, in die entfaltete</p><p>Mechanik des wiedergeborenen Spektraluniversums, zerbricht die</p><p>illuminierte Welt des Verstandes in Gleitbildern der ewig prsenten Fluoreszenz.</p><p>Zuckende Schnapsschsse und fragmentarische Skizzen der</p><p>Erkenntnis zersetzen sich zu Wellen aus Harmonie und Stille.</p><p>Entmaterealisierter Krper schwindet zum fleischlosen,</p><p>losgelsten Geist, entledigt sich seiner peripher-gewordener</p><p>Hlle um aufzusteigen in unbegreifliche Hhen und sich zu</p><p>vertiefen in den neugeschaffenen phosphorgleich Ritzen der</p><p>endlich gefundenen Zwischenwege, gebogene, verzerrte Hintertren zum pltzlich berblickbaren</p><p>Selbst.
