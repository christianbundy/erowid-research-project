 "report": [
  "On a boring summer afternoon, I had some spare cash and decided to buy 2 hits of acid off of a friend. I had tripped only 2 times before on LSD. Being a lightweight with all drugs, both trips were 1 hit at a time. I ate the first hit at around 5 pm. Since I had no plans for the night so far, I began to play video games, occasionally taking a break to watch tv. About 2 hours into the trip, I was feeling good enough to try a second hit.",
  "About 30 minutes after eating the second hit, 2 of my friends came over to smoke. I smoked 2 bowls of fairly potent cannabis with friend A and B. It was shortly after this that my visual hallucinations began to grow more vivid. The sunset looked like a spectrum from orange to purple and the grass took on a purplish tint as well. Shortly after, I discovered that a neighbor was having a party at his house.",
  "I walked across the street with friend A and B. We spent an hour in his kitchen smoking a bong and listening to music. Friend B got a ride with another friend of ours. Suddenly my neighbor's ipod dies. I offer to go to my house and grab my ipod and portable speakers. I can't recall what time it was, but it was very dark, and I had an extremely hard time seeing in the dark. The ground looked like a blank cloud covered in a rainbow blur. After finally stepping off his deck and making it back to my house, I struggle to find my ipod and speakers. Nearly 20 minutes later I return to the party. Soon the party becomes more like a rave. Several people in the house had ketamine, and another came with a very large vial of ketamine. Being in a very altered state of mind, it did not take much for my friends to convince me to do a line of K.",
  "I don't know at what point the ketamine started to take effect, but I remember dancing and feeling very distant. It seemed like I was stuck in a loop, moving in slow motion, although I could distinctly make out the constant beat of the music. Images of the people around me would spiral in slowly into my vision and morph into different images. Echos of things I said, or people around me said would repeat and fade out into the distance. The rest of the night is a blur. I took many more bumps of ketamine, and smoked a lot of cannabis throughout the night. Friend A ended up taking a capsule of molly and some ketamine.",
  "When I finally ended up going home with friend A, we took more bumps of K throughout the night. We tried to play some WoW but it was very hard for me to complete a train of thought let alone play a game. After about 10 minutes of running around in circles in WoW, I give up and decide to browse the web while watching tv until I could fall asleep. I spent several hours attempting to fall asleep, but the constant pattern like hallucinations kept me awake. Even by 10 am the next day I had still not fallen asleep, and I could still see very mild visual hallucinations. My thought process was extremely slow. My mind felt empty and drained. By now friend A had already left. I continued to watch tv and attempt to sleep until afternoon. Some time between 3pm and 8pm I had fallen asleep.",
  "Since that night, I have exhibited many sypmtoms of HPPD. Kaleidoscopic visual static, mild to severe dp/dr, and mild depression. I have a very hard time focusing and randomly become anxious. And I continue to have the disorder to this day. While that night was definitely enjoyable, I wish it had never happened."
