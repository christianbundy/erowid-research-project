 "report": "<p>The other day I was looking for some Advil for a bad headache I was having when I found some old Hydrocodone pills from when I dislocated my shoulder snowboarding. My parents had been holding on to them and I guess had simply forgotten about them. Being that I couldnt find anything else that might help my headache, I decided that it wouldnt be so bad if I took the Hydrocodone.</p><p>(9:00 pm) - I decided to take what was left of the bottle which was three 7.5 mg pills. I took them with a cold glass of water and then sat on my couch and watch some TV while I waited from my head ache to go away.</p><p>(9:32 pm)  About a half hour later my headache just faded away and then I got this sudden tingly feeling in my stomach, which I felt marked the beginning of the high for me. At first I was afraid that the stomach feeling would turn into nausea, but instead it slowly evolved into a nice warm feeling the enveloped my whole body. </p><p>(9:52 pm) - I began to feel very calm, relaxed, drowsy, and wanted to take a nap but decided I would rather stay awake and further experience the high. Also, my parents had just gotten home at this time so I wanted to try and avoid them in case the high got too intense. So, I got up and walked down into my basement to play on the computer for a little while.</p><p>(10:50 pm)  After being on the computer for a little while the high really kicking in, yet surprisingly my mind felt very open and I could think very clearly. I found that I was able to be totally normal around my parents who didnt seem to notice my current state of mind. The high was not so much a mental high but more like this euphoric mood that came along with a natural sense of all around comfort and safety. The only bad side to the high was a somewhat annoying itch that seemed to come and go around different parts of my body. Also, I was very drowsy which made It hard to concentrate and stay awake at times.</p><p> (11:20 pm)  At this time I gave in to the drowsiness and went to my room to sleep.  I decide that it would be a good idea to fall asleep listening to my iPod. This ended up being the best part of my high by far. I was able to feel a maximum level of comfort all over my body lying in my warm bed and I was able to just let my mind go as I listen to my music. The music sounded amazing and kept me awake just enough so that I entered this wired mental state. It was like I was asleep but conscious at the same time, almost like being half awake but with a much clearer mind. I think that I might have been meditating without even meaning to.</p><p>(6:00 am)- This lasted what felt like forever when I suddenly the thought popped into my head that I should charge my iPod for school in the morning. When I got up to put my iPod in its charger, I looked at the clock and it was already 5:48 am.  I hadnt really felt like I slept that night yet in the morning I felt completely rested and wasnt drowsy in the least. The high was long gone but I still pretty good.</p><p>Other than a slight stomachache, I felt completely fine and was able to function normally in school the next day. Although the experience with hydrocodone was great for me and I would love to do it again, I was glad that I didnt have any pills left after that. I had no trouble seeing why hydrocodone would become addictive. This experience, as well as when used hydrocodone for when my shoulder was dislocated, have showed me how this drug can easily become an addictive problem. Im glad that I didnt have any access to more of it after this experience because I could easily have kept taking it afterward. To anybody who is planning to take hydrocodone for recreational uses, I suggest keeping the dosage low and only using it once a week.  Also,  eat some food after taking them to lessen the chance of nausea.</p>",
