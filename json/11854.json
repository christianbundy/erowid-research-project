 "report": [
  "Substance: \t17 mg 4-ACO-DiPT taken orally at 3:00 PM",
  "Date:\t\tSeptember 7, 2008",
  "Weather:\tSunny, a pleasant 70 degrees",
  "Other: \t        10 mg Hydrocodone taken at about 11:30 AM for back pain, still feeling  minor effects at 3:00 PM.",
  "Mental Set: \tA bit irritable from the Hydrocodone comedown, but otherwise feeling pretty relaxed and calm.",
  "T+00 - I poured the powder under my tongue and took a large swig of water. My tongue was assaulted by the worst tasting RC I have ever experienced.",
  "T+15 - I did a bit of house cleaning, then headed upstairs to get ready to go for a walk in nature with my lovely wife, I noticed first alerts as I put on my socks.",
  "T+20 - My terminally dedicated sober sitter wife took the wheel and drove us along the highway to an appropriate spot where I could experience the drug in an outstanding natural setting.  As we zoomed down the highway towards our destination, I found myself coming up uncomfortably quickly, and as I often do when taking psychedelics, I was attempting to hold a fake smile weakly upon my face, with the motivation of tricking myself into believing I was having fun.  The rumble and sway of the vehicle made this phase most unpleasant, and I was feeling a strong compulsion to get the hell out of the car.  I felt as if my brain was being buffed with a medium grain sandpaper.",
  "T+30 - We arrived at a beautiful spot along a river bank, in a gorge as wide and deep as it was breathtaking.  When I got out of the car I felt rather unsteady on my feet; detached and confused, but the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet was a welcome change from the moving automobile and I immediately began to feel better, more at ease.",
  "T+45 - Despite coming on like a hurricane, in a short time things began to smooth out quite a bit, and other than some trembling due to excess stimulation, I was beginning to feel less distracted by the body load and was able to sink in and enjoy my surroundings more.  I had thought I was in for a rocky ride, but as quickly as it had come, things had leveled out to an easy plus 2 on the Shulgin scale.",
  "T+1:00 to T+2:30 - We walked along the river, letting our bare feet sink down into the mud, which felt amazing against the bottom of my feet.  There was a benign nature to this experience, and although there were many other people in the area, I didnt have the associated feeling of being overly conspicuous that I often have when tripping.  my impressions of strangers were warm and comfortable. This substance was mildly heart-opening. ",
  "Visually, there didnt seem to be a lot going on, although we were in an outstanding natural area that was amazing in its own right.  At times there was a gentle swaying or breathing on the landscape that was certainly inspired by the substance, but it was subtle.",
  "I was feeling more connected to my surroundings, and more open emotionally to those around me. Stopping to talk to a stranger on the shore was easy and at no point did I feel unable to communicate nor was I concerned that I was acting strangely.  My wife and I had a wonderful walk together, looking at various creepy crawlies slithering in the mud, and taking silly pictures of each other walking along a precipice alongside the river.  Eventually we made our way back to the car.  The substance was definitely wearing off, and I felt no ill effects from the come-down, other than being a bit more tired than I ordinarily would be after a leisurely stroll in nature.",
  "T+3:00 Back at home, I took a bath and prepared for dinner. I felt comfortable and hungry and we enjoyed a delicious meal together.  I wasnt quite at baseline at T+4:00, and still had a bit of confusion setting the DVD player up for a movie, but effects were very minor by this point.  Sleep was a bit difficult at 10:00 PM (T+7:00), but nothing that wasnt solved with a Benadryl, and in the morning I felt awake and refreshed.",
  "Overall, I would give this substance a positive review, although at this dose it wasnt overly impressive.  The come-up was abrupt and intense but it soon leveled off, so I think next time I will take a higher total dose, but administer it in two separate doses spread say an hour apart.  I would have liked to have a bit more psychological activity, and I definitely would have enjoyed more visuals.  I found this to be a very subtle substance at this dosage."
