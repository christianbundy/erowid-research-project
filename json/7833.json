 "report": [
  "Just for background, the drugs I'd taken before this were marijuana (several times a week), coedine, and alcohol.",
  "I took 30 puffs to begin with, using a spacer to ensure maximum inhalation with each dose.  I made sure to hold each puff for a second or two, inhaling deeply.  Within 2 minutes I began to feel my chest throbbing, my heart kicking into overdrive.  I also began to quiver unintentionally and couldn't sit still.  It was a  rather uncomfortable experience, but it wasn't really that bad.  I decided to up the dose, and over the course of the next 5 minutes I reached my spontaneous  goal of 100 hits, I think.  I say I think because I lost track of the count as the effects became more intense.",
  "I fell over immediately after reaching my goal, almost passing out.  However, I think that was due to the lack of oxygen I was getting from rapidly puffing on the inhaler without pause.   Within the next 10 minutes, the dose hit me, but it only increased the effects slightly.  I unintentionally shook slightly harder, and my mouth became very dry.  My heart was also beating somewhere around 180 bpm, which is VERY fast.  I also got a throbbing headache.  It lasted for around 4 hours, but I could still feel slight effects for more than a day afterwards.",
  "All in all, it was a waste of time, providing a very uncomfortable and annoying high.  Most of the effects I felt I think were due to lack of oxygen."
