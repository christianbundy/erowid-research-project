 "report": "<p>About 1.5kg of san pedro was prepared for two, using an extraction based on cutting out the woody core and using vitamin c to assist in the extraction and evaporating the water away with restricted heat.</p><p>We ended up doing about 3-4 washes. However Im not sure if my friend and I pulled it off to well, as at some point the temperature got a bit hot, and the process of filtering the pulp wasnt performed as efficiently as possible and we may have lost some material.</p><p>Anyway instead of boiling the whole amount down we were left with about 900ml each and so we drunk about 600 ml during a 30 minute period (during our car trip toward our event situated in the peaks of a forest about an hour from our home).</p><p>About an hour later I began experiencing a mild nausea that was accompanied by a mild sedation. It wasn't overpowering and didn't feel strong like an acid come on. It felt like a mild stoned feeling with a pleasant serotonergic push, which differentiated it from the typical cannabis high quite dramatically. We drank the extra 300ml each at this point as we decided it was best to consume it now that our stomachs had settled.</p><p>At about 2 to 2 and a half hours I began to feel a slight come up that felt quite familiar to that of a 2c substance. I was looking at the trees and I noticed a pleasant patterning effect, like shifting of lines and patterns (although very subtle), visuals were quite similar to 2c-i or 2c-b, but had quite a similar sensation and to that of MDMA, where one feels a euphoric attachment to visual and auditory stimulus.</p><p>I had a small amount of weed about 3.25 hours in (about half a cone) which definitely enhanced the subtleties I was feeling. I quickly began to feel quite intoxicated and noticed more stomach churning and a little bit of unease that felt as though it was a result of a confusion between physical stimulation and sedation.. I felt like dancing and I felt like sitting very calmly at the same time. It didn't seem to matter which activity I was involved in however, they all felt satisfying. So I ended up spending the next hour wondering around the bush location speaking to a few different people, while simoultaneously feeling quite introverted and mostly choosing to keep to myself wherever possible. Treating my ears to some delicious psy trance whipping up through the night air through the bush and up the hill to where a fireplace was situated as I sat staring into the flames and the darkness that lay in front of me.</p><p>About 4 and a half hours into the trip the weed was starting to wear off which made it easier to initiate conversations. When I had discussions with people it was easy to talk for extended periods of time on any topic, going at extreme depths as my ideas seemed to rotate and circulate deeper and deeper in spiral patterns. However it was quite difficult to transfer my train of thought, so when the topic was changed suddenly, my thought patterns would hit a brick wall. I would lose my intial train of thought, and if there was a gap in the conversation as the tracks changed and I felt my brain opening up different tracks of thought. It became quite easy to forget what thoughts had come before the ones I was experiencing as if I was experiencing my train of thought as a tourist watching the ideas as they presented themselves in my surrounding environment rather then critically analysing where this train was coming from and where it was heading, I was just here to indulge in the scenery. The discussions I had with people seemed to trigger different thoughts within myself as I related myself to the discussion, however my perspective had shifted, I wasnt relating my life to what was spoken of, but the way it was spoken and the thoughts it triggered within myself. I was able to direct conversations in the directions I wanted them to go, however instead of thinking about what I was actually discussing, Id think about why I was discussing that particular topic, lots of meta cognition and internalised emotions.</p><p>I also found it quite difficult to ground my thoughts, yet I had absolutely no desire to ground them anyway. It was a content type of feeling. There werent many visuals throughout the trip, except for maybe a kind of colour bleeding and shifting of lines. The trip was fairly introspective, not as much as mushrooms or LSD usually is, but definitely more so then 2cs usually are. I attribute the subtle effects and visuals to our poor extraction technique. The visuals seemed to be on par with 2c-t-2, they could get quite geometric if I really looked for visuals but they didn't jump out at me, perhaps to the same extent that MDMA would typically jump out at someone (a euphoric attachment to colour).</p><p>I tried to settle my thoughts and have a rest at about 6 hours, which didnt really work, I felt quite tired, but not vacant. I was quite too stimulated and philosophical to sleep but quite content closing my eyes in contemplation. With my eyes closed I experienced some subtle colour shifts behind my eyelids, mostly just 2-dimensional patterns shifting and allowing me to sink out of my typical conciousness and into a higher spiritual plane of thought. At this point I decided to eat 1 fresh mushroom that probably only weighed about 1g.</p><p>By about 8 hours after ingesting the cactus soup, I felt like the effects were starting to subside, so I smoked some weed, and the high began to feel more cannabis orientated with a slightly different edge to it, possibly caused by the mushroom. My body still felt quite good, and I was able to dance, before heading back to the car again for a rest. My muscles had this awkward sensation to them, they were fatigued from dancing throughout and walking throughout the night, however it was more just a desire to relax which wasnt quite satisfied how it normally is, just felt like I was sitting down. Like I wasnt at all tired, but didnt really have energy either. I could dance all I wanted, but my mind felt like it didnt really have any real incentive to..</p><p>Summary</p><p>At my most philosophical points just standing (or sitting) staring into space. I remember thinking of the world in terms of bacteria, infecting the world and rapidly multiplying as bacteria and disease spreads within us rapidly multiplying (a common psychedelic thought). As the possibilities begin existing in gigantic proportions, I began contemplating my life choices, and any damage that I might causing to the bush from camping here and playing music. Considering my own death as an advantage to the rest of the world as I would no longer be a pollutant or whether I should try to stay alive and hopefully inspire others to be less harmful. Debating whether I am a positive or a negative person, and what my fears are.</p><p>However the experience was in no way intense, and the thoughts I visited have mostly been visited before on previous psychedelic experiences. So I wasnt particularly impressed, as I had been expecting a more profound experience (perhaps expecting too much). I think I missed out on having a proper mescaline experience, if such a thing exists.Though as Ive heard many say, it is more of a life enhancement rather then a true psychedelic in its traditional sense (A stimulant, a phenethylamine). I dont really know how deep one can go on mescaline.</p><p>The effort one must go to aquire mescaline seems to difficult when compared with the attainability of various other psychedelics. It had a pleasant euphoria similar to other 2c's and MDMA, but I think I may stick with the more easily obtainable psychedelics for a while as its a little frustrating that I didn't think I achieved a full-on mescaline experience. However it was still quite a pleasant and rewarding experience, and I would gladly repeat it again if it were to fall in my lap through someone who's more experienced with this substance and was able to offer me a more entheogenic experience in its mescalines traditional sense perhaps.</p>",
