 "report": "</p>\nI had however been considering doing a pill for some time and had informed myself about it by reading pretty much everything on ecstasy.org and Erowids MDMA vault.</p><p>Me and my girlfriend took the pills at around 11pm, and were coming up pretty good by about midnight, the first signs I felt were a tingling sensation starting in my head and travelling down my body, then, not long after that I noticed I was truly rolling hard, I hadn't really had a 'rush' type come-up, but noticed that the conversation with our friends had become much more personal and intimate without us even realising it. The best word I have to describe it is that ideas flowed like 'liquid'.</p><p>Throughout that evening I had a much greater feel and understanding for music, and felt a total overwhelming sense of being at peace. I am a reflective and intellectual kind of person, and I think I gained a lot from the E in terms of alleviating the inner dialogue, and also in terms of the lessons I have learned and the different perspective I have gained since doing the pill, It has truly been a life changing experience.</p><p>I know drugs are a supremely individual thing and a different pattern of usage is right for every different person, but from the experiences my friends and I have had I think that anyone using E on a weekly basis, even if they are only doing one pill a week, is seriously missing out on something, this drug has such a potential for self exploration and learning and hasn't stopped showing me new things about the world and about other people since I dropped it. It will take me a long time to fully integrate into my life all it has taught me and to use it again too soon would defile the experience.</p><p>I intend to use MDMA again, maybe two or three times a year at most, but I remember my 'moment of enlightenment' (and it truly was), when I sat in my chair rollin' and thought to myself 'This is just me and my girlfriend and my mates, this is not the E'.</p><p>I have been able to use this lesson and put what I learnt into practice since and do not need drugs to feel a sense of community with my friends. It is like the teachers of zen say about E - it is not a route to perfection but sometimes a glimpse of the goal helps to focus the mind.</p>",
