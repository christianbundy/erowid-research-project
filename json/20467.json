 "report": [
  "A few years ago, I decided to stop drinking alcohol after a bad experience and thought I try instead a 'legal high'.  Having read a little bit about yohimbe and finding a local seller, I figured a drug that could enhance sex even more sounded like fun, so I sent off for the raw grounded bark. ",
  "Early one morning, pre-dawn, nervous and not quite knowing what to expect, I decided to try it and spend the day in bed with my wife.  I had read somewhere to use 6 Tblspoons(!!), but figured I play it safe and used only 4 tspoons, boiled it up for 30 mins with vitamin C powder.  Straining and adding lots of honey, I drank it slowly over 20 minutes while sucking on a grapefruit to cover its awful flavour.",
  "At first I thought nothing was going to happen, but by the time I'd finished the cup, I started feeling funny body sensations and thought it was pretty good.  Then things got really bad.  I started to shake and tremor, my eyes turned blood red and my heart pounded and raced, as though it was going to jump out of my chest.  I was terrified, but I resisted the temptation to go to hospital, instead deciding to ride it through.  I stayed in that state for 3 hours, before my heart started to calm down a bit, feeling mildly nauseated all the while.  I couldn't lie still without shaking and listening to my heart, so I spent most of that time pacing and walking around agitated, wondering if I was going to die.",
  "My wife was unhappy and offered to ring for an ambulance, but I did convince her to try sex after 2 hours with me in that state.  I was hard to get aroused, which is not normal for me, and even harder to finish.  Far from fun.",
  "My heart was flighty for the rest of the day and I felt like I'd been through a trauma.  However, finally, late that night (16hours later?), I had sex again, and the finish was prolonged and spectacular, and made me gasp, also not normal for me!",
  "I read up on the topic some more and worked out I had overdosed.  But when I tried much smaller quanities in the weeks that followed, my body went into terror mode as soon as it touched my lips.  My heart starting pounding, my head felt light headed and shaky and I couldn't go through with it.  I chucked it all out.",
  "After that, I developed panic attacks, going into the some heart racing mode in response to sometimes eating food, sometimes for no reason whatsoever.  I was determined not to let it conquer me and after a personal battle with it, which I won't get into here, I eventually got over the irratic attacks after 3 months.",
  "Part of truly conquering it, however, I realized I had to try yohimbe again.  A year later, I sent off for some more and drank a teaspoon prepared as before.  I half panicked, but faced down that fear and realized it was my mind, not the tea that was making my heart race. ",
  "I was always a 'nervous' sort of guy and panic attacks run in my family, so in retrospect, I'm not surprised it triggered the response in me.  But I'm glad of it, because instead of developing it later in my life, like my mother who ever since was hooked on Valium, Zantac, etc, it happened in a more controlled way and ultimately allowed me to conquer it.",
  "Since then, I have continued to occasionally drink yohimbe tea, best dosage 1 1/2 teaspoons.  I don't get a racing heart anymore, but can get light headedness if I have high tyromine foods (chocolate, high MSG, etc), so I avoid them the day before and after.  It doesn't taste that bad at that dose and boiled with a little bit of grapefruit juice and sipped over 40 minutes while sucking on an orange.  At the right dose, it gives me an interesting rush of body sensations and high energy state.  I wouldn't say it makes me horny so much as it makes the experience of sex more intense, especially the finish.  Including the second and third times! :)"
