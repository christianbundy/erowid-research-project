 "report": [
  "I started my day rather normally, i woke, shaved, showered, and grabbed a cup of Starbucks on the way to school.  Nothing much, just a small latte.  It kept me going for the morning and by the afternoon i was tired because it worked its way through my system.",
  "I was on the technical staff of the school's theater department and we had a show that evening around 7:00.  I was tired and offered to make the dinner/drink run for the group.  I stopped at some fast food restaurants and the local supermarket.  There i made the 2nd best decision of the day (the first was getting a date for the weekend):  I bought 3 6-packs of Jolt and 3 Red Bulls.",
  "Because of the small size of a Red Bull, i drank all three before the drive to the school was finished (less than 5 miles).  I was thinking, 'Hey, this is great, i'm awake, I'll be back early, and life will be good.'  Unfortunately, I was going 85 in a 35 and ended up with a hefty ticket.  (I told the officer that i'd give him a free seat at the show if he let me off with just the ticket.  Good thing that he liked high school theater.)",
  "I made my way back to the school, carefully going the speed limit and avoiding the Jolt in the back of the car.  Upon arriving, i cracked a Jolt and then another Jolt and then another and a fourth.  The first 6-Pack was down.  I don't remember much of the next 10 minutes, only that the set was fixed from a massive injury to it the previous night, it was rebuilt and back up.  The rest of the crew was also looking at me strangely and asking if i needed any 'help.'  I said no and went on my hyper-whacked way.",
  "I started feeling tired a few minutes later and it was back to the car. In 5 minutes i downed 7 jolts and was back in the theater.  Curtain was 10 minutes away and i had just finished 12 cans of Jolt and 3 Red Bulls in about 45 minutes.  I was pumped.  Everyone around me was going, 'Calm down, it's just a show.  Calm down.'  Needless to say, the set changes that normally take 1-3 minutes, i did almost single-handedly in about 30-45 seconds.",
  "I was dropping around intermission and finished off the last 6-Pack.  The show finished early and my crew chief was worried about letting me drive him home.  He asked for my keys and i just walked back to my car in a hyper-stupor and left him there.",
  "I arrived home earlier than normal (i didn't know an 85 Accord could go THAT fast) and by the time i arrived home i was seeing spots. I couldn't get to sleep for nearly 19 hours and after that I passed out almost immediately.  i don't remember any of the next 36 hours, but i do know that when i awoke there was a small amount of blood on my pillow and it was a day and a half later.  I don't know if i actually woke during that period or not.",
  "To make a long story short, we had a great show, and that's about all i can remember. The caffeine helped immensely, and i'll be sure to have more the next time i work on a show."
