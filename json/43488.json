 "report": "<p>I Received 2g of DiPT and 1 gram of DPT and wanted to give one of them a test run.  All the people who participated in this are experienced Psychedelic users with the exception of one friend who I will call R.</p><p>We decided on taking DiPT weighed out 100mg a piece and took it up the nose.  There was no real preparation as soon as we had our individual doses we took it.  I was alright but the rest of my friends were literally pacing due to the extreme pain.</p><p>For me almost instantly my head felt heavy, my ears felt a very extreme pressure, and my throat felt like a hole was being literally burnt into it.  Due to insufflating other substances in the past with no problems I was not ready for any of this but again experience was probably why I took it better than any of the others with me.</p><p>T+:0:05: I start to sweat BAD!  I have to drink water.  I ask for water, I need it right now!  Out of 6 people no one hears me.  I try again asking someone to please give me water.  Everyone is pacing they are all out of it.</p><p>T+:0:10.  I decide to go outside if they cant hear.  I can get a drink out of a hose or something.  I dont feel anything and I know its because of the pain that they cant hear me; yes the pain is that bad.</p><p>T+:0:15: Now Im confused my thoughts are boggled cant think at all trying to organize thought is hard I cant get to hose its to confusing is there even a hose I dont know, but people followed me!  I ask the host R where she keeps the cups so I can get water.  She tells me and I get water.</p><p>OHHHHHHH feels so good drinking water need another cup I Drank around 5 cups of water it was so nice.</p><p>We are at about 20 minutes at this point I stop keeping track of time now the pain has finally subsided.  I feel fine except some odd shifting going on in my peripheral vision. Out of a group of 6 all puked with the exception of me.</p><p>I finally take note that everyone is gone!  Some are inside some are outside some took off down the road.  I meet up with my friend D and we decide to find our friends P and E.  Who both take off down the street.  Wow it feels funny walking.  Stuff is moving slightly but nothing big.  I just feel warped and demented.</p><p>We find P and E walking up the street toward us.  We have a hilarious conversation due to the messed up voices P is the only one that sounds normal everyone else sounds baritone.  We decide to put on some music and see what happens I decide to put on something we all know so we could see just how messed up the difference in sound is if any so I slip on some Perfect Circle Imagine.  It sounds way to happy its not supposed to be happy I even start to doubt I put in the right CD it gets to me and I check yep perfect circle damn thats weird.</p><p>Ok now for the religious significance.  We are all inside and I felt like it was chaos horrible chaos everyone seemed evil their laughing sounded fake their smiles empty.  I didnt like it at all surrounded by walls just wasnt right the TV going.  I couldnt take it so I went outside.</p><p>The beauty of nature I sat on the balcony and I heard everything.  I was awed by the beauty of nature.  Not at the visual beauty but the sound.  I watched one spot for one raindrop to land their so I could hear just that one and when it happened it was marvelous.  When it hit it happened in slow motion I saw the explosion and watched as that one raindrop soaked into the ground.  I listened to the trees as they waved in the wind just amazing.  It is literally impossible to explain except to say utterly miraculous.  I sat and thought about the infinite nature of the universe and how we perceive infinity a circle or a sphere.  As the sounds of nature went around me I felt that our world was as infinite as the space around us and the possibilities just as infinite.</p><p>The trip kept going but there is nothing worthwhile about the rest, it would just get repetitive.  I havent had the desire to try DIPT again I dont know why it was a beautiful experience.  I know I will again but the desire just isnt there at the moment.  Another note during this experience one of the 6 felt like they were going to die and was hallucinating visually really hard.  Every one of us had a different trip.</p>",
