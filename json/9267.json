 "report": [
  "So there I was, sitting at home on a Saturday night, bored out of my mind. It was around 8pm when my friend called me and told me she got shrooms and lots of weed, and that I should go to her place to hang out for the night. I got there at around 9pm, and noticed a few other friends there. Pretty much as soon as I walked through the door, I was handed some E. They had all already done some so I figured I may as well. I've done E a few times before so it wasn't really that big of a deal.",
  "About half an hour later, she goes to her room and brings out the shrooms. I've never done shrooms before so I was pretty excited. One of my friends (who is also my dealer) told me I should only do 1 gram because it's my first time and I'm pretty small. I trust him, so I took his advice. It took about half an hour to start feeling it. My body felt incredible. I could feel everything in my body working. Every cell, every organ, everything. Not long after that, my blood felt really heavy and I could feel it flowing through my veins and it felt like it was pulling my body down towards the ground because it was so heavy.",
  "It felt like I was starting to come down a bit from the shrooms when we decided to do a few lines of cocaine. I've only done cocaine once before, and I have to say, it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I was absolutely miserable when I was coming down, though. The cocaine hit me pretty fast and the shrooms were kicking in again. I was feeling the psychological euphoria of the cocaine, the physical euphoria of the shrooms, and the ecstasy of, well, ecstasy. It was so intense. I've never felt anything like it before. I was spewing out every thought that came into my mind. I can't believe how much I talked. I usually get really philosophical when I'm high, but this was way more than I usually get. We smoked a bowl of weed from my friend's bong, then ordered pizza. I couldn't eat a single bite. Food was the absolute last thing on my mind then, and I just wasn't hungry.",
  "I was looking at one of my friends because we were talking, and right behind him was this cord coming from the ceiling and going down the wall. It was right next to the door frame and when I looked directly at it, the cord and the door frame started swirling and morphing together. I realized what was happening and shook my head and looked at it again, only to see the cord and the door frame perfectly straight.",
  "Not long after my little hallucination, we decided to do even more lines of cocaine. This just pushed me right to the edge. I felt like I was beyond everything. It's so hard to explain. Everyone was so beautiful and I was so happy. I think that night was the happiest I've ever been in my life. The only thing that makes me sad about that is the fact that it was artificial. It was the drugs that were making me feel that way.",
  "There was a bit of shrooms left so we figured we may as well split them up and eat the rest. Right after that, we smoked a joint. By this time, it was around 12am. It felt like so much later. I can't believe how bad our sense of time was thrown off. We were switching back and forth to reggae and ambient music. At that point, it was the ambient music playing, and it couldn't have been more perfect. I was letting my hand flow to the music and I started seeing multiple hands. My hand also looked slurred. Kind of like smeared paint but in the air. I was doing that for about 20 minutes.",
  "After that, we each did two bumps of cocaine and passed around the pipe. I was a little hesitant to do more cocaine because I didn't really want to push this feeling any more. I did it anyways. I decided to have a cigarette after we finished the pipe. It felt so weird when I put the cigarette out. Like something was missing. I just had to smoke. I was lighting one cigarette right after the other. I smoked an entire pack to myself that night.",
  "My friend wanted to dim the lights but I couldn't even deal with it. I would freak out and I have no idea why. There was a light on in some other room behind me and when my friend got up and turned it off, I begged him to put it back on. There just had to be light. I couldn't deal with it being any darker.",
  "I put out my cigarette and looked at my pack. At that point, cigarettes were the most repulsive thing on the planet to me. I realized how selfish smoking is. I went on this huge rant about how when people smoke, then only do it for themselves. They only have themselves in mind when they light up a cigarette. No good at all comes from smoking. It harms everyone and everything. At that point, I decided I'm going to quit smoking. I have no reason to smoke. I don't want to be selfish anymore.",
  "The night was sort of dying down by around 2am. Everyone was just quiet and off in their own little world. For the longest time, I couldn't stop thinking about myself, and who I am to people and what I mean to them. I also felt really spiritually connected with everyone, even though we weren't really talking much anymore. A few people were pretty tired but I was still completely wired. At around 3am we all decided we should go to bed. The last time I looked at my watch before I think I fell asleep, was at 6:30am. I couldn't tell if I was sleeping or not. All I know is that I was dead tired the next day.",
  "I learned a few things that night. Never again am I doing that many drugs in one night. I pumped my body with so many drugs this weekend. I'm going to lay back for about a month. I also quit smoking. There's one more thing I learned. My experience, along with everyone else's, is just another good story."
