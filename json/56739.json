 "report": "<p>A few nights ago, as my boyfriend lay asleep, I found myself unable to relax. I thought I remembered him placing some cold medicine into his empty tic tac container, and so thinking I would fall asleep faster, I grabbed two of the pills and swallowed them with half a bottle of water. I lay down with the placebo expectation of becoming drowsy, and shut my eyes.</p><p>Approximately forty-five minutes later, I felt sweaty and opened my eyes to the walls melting off, curling into multi-colored snake skins and the bed began to swallow me alive. I wasn't frightened at all, having much experience with tripping, as well as hallucinating due to insomnia/deep depression. I was concerned about my body temperature, and about how massive the spatial dimensions of the room had increased to. I woke up my boyfriend and asked him what was in the tic tac box, and he said 2C-I. Instantly I knew I was in for a long ride.</p><p>He tried to have me force myself to vomit, but it was too late. I had never tried the drug before, but I also knew that I had taken a huge dose at 40 mg, since 20 mg is considered a strong one. Being my first time, I expected the visuals would be similar to lsd, but they were far more enveloping. Kaliedoscopic patterns, pastel colors, stars shining out of my periphery. I wasn't just tripping into objects, I was seeing entire landscapes transformed, rebuilt before my eyes as I went for a walk outside.</p><p>About 5 hours into the trip, after adjusting to the altered depth perception and gorgeous colors, I decided to explore through meditation. I have done yoga for 2 years, and so I began stretching into relaxation poses to go deeper into the experience. With 2C-I, I was able to do emotional searching like I had always wanted to use lsd as a tool for, but never could. Also with this drug came a body high similar to mdma, which I noticed after I had adjusted to the visuals. Overall, though it came about entirely by accident, the trip was a valued experience, especially because I went into it with no expectations/anticipation, and therefore could let it work on me organically.</p>",
