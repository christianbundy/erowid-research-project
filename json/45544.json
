 "report": "</p>\nPrevious mystical experiences: A feeling of pure bliss/love while meditating on mushrooms  knowing that I and everything else was God.</p><p>Previous drug experiences: I sniffed coke about twenty times during a span of about a year/ Consumed E at least once every weekend for about four months/Tried acid once/Smoked crystal for about two weeks .</p><p>Previous plant experiences: Ive smoked a lot of Cannabis/ Ive smoked salvia divinorum a few times in the last month (only light doses). </p><p>I have been mediating daily for about a few months now, and Ive experienced some pretty incredible coincidences. When I tap into this infinite organizing field of intelligence, my deepest wishes seem to manifest. But something happened today that I was not expecting. I was kind of stressed out, so I decided that I would mediate for a while. I hopped on my bed and closed my eyes. While lying down, I used the mantra so- hum (thinking the word so while inhaling, and hum while exhaling, while concentrating on the sound of my breath)(1). I also would periodically stop the breath work (every minute or two), and just lay there in silence  allowing no thoughts to enter my consciousness. When this became too difficult to sustain, I would return to the breath work.</p><p>Im guessing that I was meditating for about fifty minutes, and then it happened. My body felt very light, and I could sense that I was disconnecting from it. I then consciously made it my intention to leave my body (although I didnt actually think it was going to happen). I felt myself going up towards the roof in a quick-like fashion  and even though I didnt look down  it was evident that I was out of my body ( I could see that I was in my room , even though my eyes were closed). I wasnt really happy or scared at first  I just 'was'. I then started to think that maybe I would die if I stayed 'out' for an extended period of time, so I tried to return to my body. I opened my eyes (which was difficult), and I laid there in amazement. An out of body experience  and I wasnt even high! This was the most amazing thing that I have ever experienced. Next time, Ill see if I can prolong the experience for a little longer.    </p><p>(1)  this is the mantra Deepak Chopra recommends</p>",
