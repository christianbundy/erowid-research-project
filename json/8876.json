 "report": [
  "Alright, well I'll start by saying that I am 16 and am a somewhat healthy person. I am a very frequent marijuana user, about 1-3 times a day. I take no medication, and have tried DXM a few times, shrooms once, alcohol, and pot. I go to therapy because I am facing a few relationship troubles in my life along with school and the law. I am basically a reasonable person and am mostly level headed. On this particular day, I hadn't planned on doing the seeds that night, but I was in a good mood all day.",
  "Preparation:",
  "About a month prior, I picked up 5 packets of Burpee Heavenly Blue Morning Glory Seeds at $1.79 a pack weighing apx. 1.5 g each. Total, there were 272 seeds exactly. I was unaware if the seeds were coated with pesticides, etc., so I put them in a tuperware dish with a little bit of washing detergent and water. I shook them for about a minute, washed them, and repeated. I let them sit overnight on a paper towel to dry. The next day, I dumped the seeds into our Mr. Coffee coffee grinder. I ground the seeds almost to powder. They were milky yellow looking and smelled a little like nuts, but very unique. I dumped them all onto a plate and seperated the chunkier parts from the powder because I planned on grinding up the chunks more, but I didn't bother.",
  "Setting:",
  "My room in late March in the Chicago suburbs after my mom fell asleep. I stayed in my room the almost the entire time until I fell asleep.",
  "T-0:00 hrs:",
  "The time was about 10:15 when I poured the powdered seeds into a cup of bottled water. I decided to try and avoid tap water because of the extra ions and chemicals found in it that I heard could break down the LSA. I didn't put the chunky seeds in simply because I didn't know how strong the effects were. I regret that. The water looked kinda gross, but I downed it. It didn't taste bad at all and went down pretty easily. I went downstairs to drink a few glasses of orange juice; I heard that vitamin C can aid in psychedelic experiences.",
  "T-0:30 hrs:",
  "I went outside to have a cigarette behind my garage and noticed that there was a kind of light distortion in my peripheral vision. The ground seemed to be somewhat glowing. Very subtle, but I got excited. I went back inside to my room and put on a skateboarding video to waste a little time.",
  "T-1:00 hrs:",
  "After about half the video is done, I didn't really feel any effects. My pupils were pretty dialated and my eyes were somewhat bloodshot. My eyes get shot really easily. I became a little disappointed because I thought onset was supposed to arrive at about 1 hour.",
  "T-1:20 hrs:",
  "Believing that I had made a dud mixture, I decided to take out my bowl. I didn't have any weed, so I scraped the sides of my piece and got about 7 nice resin hits off of it.",
  "T-1:30 hrs:",
  "I felt a nice high from smoking, and got excited again. I looked at my eyes and they were almost fully dialated. I started laughing at the insane look on my face. I laid back down and closed my eyes to see some cool visuals.",
  "T-1:45 hrs:",
  "I saw that it is almost a half hour since I smoked and I still felt pretty blitzed. Usually after only a few hits I am coming down after about 15-20 min. Things started to have a sort of psychedelic feel to them. My sense of touch was intensified because I remember sliding my hands across my bed and feeling really good.",
  "T-2:10 hrs:",
  "The effects were definitely set in by this point. Smoking was the perfect entrance into the trip, though I'd really classify this more as a high than a trip. I put on some Electric Light Orchestra and Pink Floyd and laid back down in my bed. The music was very visual behind my eyes. I was able to 'see' the guitar's notes in Shine On You Crazy Diamond. Everything seemed so wonderful. I had a permanent smile on my face for about the entire time. In the dark my walls seemed to have a colored dotting effect and were quite translucent. I thought about a lot of issues in my life and didn't exactly resolve any of them, but I felt good about where I stood on many of them. It seemed like it was impossible for the trip to turn bad. With shrooms, I had a terrible trip (I thought that my friends were my hallucinations and were actually police). Overall I felt great",
  "T-3:00-5:00 hrs:",
  "During this time I was grooving pretty good to the music I was listening to: ELO, Pink Floyd, Polyphonic Spree (very psychedelic, especially 'Soldier Girl'), Led Zeppelin, and The Beattles. I put my CD (about 1 hr. long) on repeat. Every time I heard a song it felt like the first time I had ever heard it and I was transfixed on the glowing rhythms of it all. I laughed at myself because I knew that it was just silly, but that thought just made everything hilarious. My visuals were a little blurred, but everything was very colorful. My sense of touch was very intense and I tried to touch just about every texture I could find.",
  "T-6:00 hrs:",
  "I got a little tired of my music and decided that I should probably go to sleep (about 4:30 am). Everything still had a psychedelic afterglow and my eyes were still a little dialated, but not fully anymore. I closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep, but found it more difficult than I had imagined. It probably took me about 45 min. to eventually fall into a deep sleep.",
  "Next day:",
  "My eyes look a little tired, but nothing out of the ordinary. I felt no hangover effects at all. I felt groggy due to the fact that I only got 5 hrs. of good sleep, but again, nothing out of the ordinary.",
  "In the future I plan on taking about 350 ground seeds using the same preparation method that I used before. On another note, I felt minimal to no nausea. I think the only nausea I felt was because I was aware that MG could cause nausea. I think that if I hadn't known that, it would have been completely fine. I compare this to a light shroom trip, but I think it would have been better if I had taken all of my seeds and if I had been in a more stimulating environment than my bedroom."
