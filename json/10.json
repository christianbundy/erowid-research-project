  "<p>'Such Beauty. Fuck.' These three words were all I could conjure to explain what I was experiencing with the new and yet-to-be fully understood 2C-I-NBOME aka 25-I. Those three words do not even present the tip of the iceberg that is this wonderful experience from such an interesting and inspiring molecule.",
  "First off I will 'qualify' my understanding of the psychedelic (and otherwise intoxicated) headspace. I have used a variety of psychedelics including the classics LSD, mushrooms, MDMA and also a few of the Shulgin line - 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, DPT, 2C-I, 2C-E. I am a regular cannabis user, and have experienced a wide variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, and dissociatives.",
  "At the time of this experience I was as sober as I could be considering I am tapering off both Suboxone (buprenorphine & naloxone) and clonazepam. These substances were taken at small maintenance doses over 24hrs prior to ingesting the 25-I blotters to ensure they would not lessen or otherwise change the trip but to keep my body in a state of relative homeostasis. I was admittedly breaking a few of my own rules - tripping on a whim with no real plan at home with some family who I knew I would probably end up avoiding as the effects took hold. Keep in mind I have tried 25-I in previous sessions at similar dosages - the first was 900mcg taken foolishly with a large amount of clonazepam and buprenorphine still active in my system and the second a few days after 1.2mg IV. The 25-I experience itself I now know is very malleable - much more so than LSD and even mushrooms. The one startling aspect of this chemical is its overwhelming euphoria and positivity. I have never felt this feeling other than small glimpses during orgasm or the rush of a strong intraveneous opiate. MDMA experiences were not even close - I personally find MDMA a useless and very superficial experience. The absolute pleasure from 25-I is not only felt and understood but multiplied by its exploration/understanding and is almost controllable. The headspace differs entirely in that it has 3 out of 3 times been positive, euphoric, and almost relaxing. It seems to have everything I am looking for - it is wildly visual and euphoric while leaving the minds logic systems mostly intact - this is the only chemical in which I have experienced such intense feelings of euphoria and both open and closed-eye visuals without wondering 'what is going on?' and losing touch - the loss of ego. I suspect higher doses will be needed to yield this kind of reality-shattering. That is my summary of 25-I but now on to last night:",
  "T 0:00 - 2 blotters are placed between the gums and cheek, one on top and one on the bottom lip. This is not complexed but since it is the hydrochloride salt of 25-I, it is well absorbed if proper buccal technique is observed. I personally recommend keeping the blotters in contact with the gums/cheeks in various positions even as the drugs effects come on.",
  "T+0:30 - Although many say this is a slow-to-develop experience, I have noticed the familiar shimmer and intensifying of colors while also feeling a building energy - some friends have noted this come up as 'frightening' in intensity but compared to the 2C line it is just a small buildup of energy.",
  "T+1:00 - I decide it is time to prepare a shower as I find the effects building and building. My pupils are already dilating at this point and I can feel fluctuations in body temperature much more. There is a bubbling in the stomach that I would not call nausea by any means - just something I noted. In fact food/hunger is not only perfectly normal but strangely enjoyable tripping on 25-I, whereas with LSD and most other psychedelics I find any unnatural foods bizarre and unappealing. As I shower I also note the physical pleasure of this chemical coming on - I can imagine it would be a potent aphrodisiac used in the right setting.",
  "T+2:00 - I decide to take a night time bike ride with headphones - great idea! I am feeling the euphoria kicking in full force now and combined with the small but noticeable 2C-x energy I venture deep into the woods. At this point I can not fully see because the visuals are multiplying rapidly. I stop and smoke a cigarette and contemplate how hard it is for an American to find secluded nature anymore. I feel apologetic for paving over natural landscapes and natural beauty with our suburban and urban centers. At this point I note my euphoria is stronger than anything I have felt in my life previously (possibly due to the extreme affinity for this molecule to certain receptors).",
  "T+3:00 - Time dilation has begun and the entire world is awash in patterns and tracers. A note about pattern recognition. Visually, at least, this chemical seems to play tricks with the brains system of 'filling in' periphery. Usually when I focus on a point the brain fills in the rest of my vision with memory and logical assumptions - while on 25-I this trick of the mind is exposed. I focus on a point and it becomes almost 4-D in clarity as the entire periphery flows with reccurring patterns the mind inserts to fill in the lack of visual stimuli. These are not like any other visuals I have seen which are usually purely geometrical - they are also MC Escher-esque in repetition - rows and rows of horses marching into shadows of other rows of horses - tree branches interconnecting and exploding out in ways that defy physics, etc.",
  "T+4:00 - At this point time becomes of no concern. I walk around the street with my dogs and feel extreme empathy and understanding towards them. It is as if we are linked. Conversation with some friends at this point is very fun as I can interact with an almost unnoticeable amount of confusion - as we all know other psychedelics that produce such profound effects also seem to profoundly affect communication and thought. 25-I, at moderate-strong dosages seems to leave my sanity and social abilities intact which still rewarding the user with incredible physical/mental euphoria and inexplicably beautiful visuals.",
  "It is yet to be seen what large doses would do to the mental facilities as I have only heard of increasing confusion with the already overwhelming euphoria and visual experience. I spent a few hours listening to music, drinking beer, and talking with friends over cigarettes and cannabis. This psychedelic agrees with cannabis more than any other. It does not illicit the instant intense paranoia that may be precipitated if one smokes, for example, during the peak of a strong LSD trip. It will increase visuals and euphoria but leave the mind in a positive and relaxed state. I'd venture to say this stuff is almost sedating at points - especially with cannabis thrown in. I could sit still and feel my head getting heavy almost like the nod you would get from a strong opiate.",
  "To sum up a long and convoluted, quickly-written report: this is my new favorite psychedelic. After enough intense trips I had sworn off LSD entirely and most research chemicals due to either bad trips or just dirty, crummy physical feelings. This chemical does everything I want and more. A very unexpected surprise that I feel should continue to be explored as safely as possible. I would recommend this to any beginner because of the guaranteed positive, enjoyable, and very entertaining quality of the experience but would also dissuade them because of the relative newness of the molecule and widely varied experiences among individuals/dosages. 2 other friends have used this chemical at similar doses (2 blotters totaling 1.2mg) and at first expressed fright during the come up. I attributed this to them having only experience with LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA but none of the weird electrical energy during a 2C-x come-up. Later they said much of the same - all positive thoughts and euphoric feelings both physically and mentally coupled with amazing visuals and an ease at thinking/socializing with sober individuals.",
  "One last note. The first trip ended pretty abruptly probably due to the amount of benzodiazepines in my circulation and my taking more to purposefully get to sleep once I had satisfied my psychedelic urges. Last night, after a full 9hrs past ingestion and 1hr after ingesting 5mg clonazepam, 3mg buprenorphine, 50mg diphenhydramine, a few beers, a few joints of high-grade west-coast bud (Master Kush and Berry White), and a large meal, I felt tired but was unable to sleep and could still, with barely any focus, experience incredible visual patterning and Escher-esque repetitions. Such beauty.",
