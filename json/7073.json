 "report": [
  "I first tried mushrooms at the urging of a friend who was very experienced in psychadelics. He encouraged me to eat them, in spite of the fears I had, and promised that he would take care of me and not allow me to feel uncomfortable with anything I was saying or doing. After a beautiful and lifechanging first trip with him, and an unbreakable bond because of it, I decided I was ready to take it a little further. The first time I tripped, I remained completely aware of everything that was happening and when I realized I could make the ceiling ripple in any direction I wanted, I just thought 'That's interesting.'",
  "The second time, I was with a different friend, a female friend of mine, and we had been planning to trip for a few weeks since she hadn't experienced it in years. So we made the date and at the beginning of July, 2004, we got down to it. Neither of us had eaten much that day, and we both consumed 3.5 grams, followed by large glasses of orange juice. The first time, it had taken about an hour and a half to feel the effects. This time, owing to the lack of food in my stomach, I begin to feel the beginnings of loosening limbs, the first sign I was tripping. Since my apartment was nothing compared to the natural beauty we could be in outside, we decided to go to a ark before I was tripping to hard to drive.\r[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]",
  "So we left and by the time we arrived, we were both tripping pretty hard. Her dog was with us, and we skipped around with him, marveling at the beauty of the trees, mountains, grass, bark, sky, everything. I believe there are some photos of me with my friend, a large cottonwood tree. We were having a wonderful time and had just about peaked at this point, when 4 or 5 middle aged strangers came off of one of the trails, also with dogs. My friend's dog was desperate to play with the other dogs and the people, being friendly, engaged us in conversation about what type of dog he was, etc. It was aweful. She was laughing hysterically and looking at the ground while I tried to hold the conversation together without the strangers thinking we were tripping. After about 15 minutes we dragged her dog away from their dogs, made excuses and ran frantically back to my car.",
  "Once we got back to the car, we locked ourselves in and could not stop talking about how horrible it was to come across strangers while we were tripping. We were starting to trip harder and I had to drive back to my apartment. Luckily, it was only about 2 miles from the park. I remember feeling like we were flying through space and watching my hands hold the steering wheel like they were the biggest hands in the world. I just kept repeating 'I should win a medal for driving right now' and my friend's hair was floating through the air moving through the car.",
  "We made it back to my apartment, avoided talking to my neighbors, and locked ourselves inside. Things started to get a little overwhelming at this point, and my friend would not stop talking. I was too overcome to speak, but she was getting really angry at me for not talking and kept demanding that I speak to her. her eyes were hugely dialated and really freaking me out, so I agreed to talk to her as long as I didn't have to look at her. I realized that I was starting to trip even harder at this point and that we needed a trip-sitter. I called my friend who had taken me on my first trip, and he agreed to come over and take care of us.",
  "By the time he arrived, I was tripping harder than ever. I wanted to talk to him about energy, and the inaccuracy of time and things like that, but my other friend was not in the same spiritual mood for this sort of debate. We knew we had to get out of the apartment, so he told us to get ready to go hiking. The strangest part of this was that when I was putting my shoes on to go hiking, it felt like my feet kept disappearing. I could see them, but it felt like they would disappear, and then suddenly reappear. It was a little scary, but because my friend who came to take care of us was so experienced, I didn't want to seem like a wuss in front of him and kept this to myself.",
  "Finally, we got in the car. As we left the city, there was a cop who had pulled someone over with his lights flashing. I remember it looked like fountains of red and blue sparks were arching up from the lights and it was really intense. Once we got on the highway, I remember looking at mountains I had seen for years like I had never seen them before. I was in total awe of how beautiful they were and asked if they had always been there. There were a lot of forest fires at the time, too, so there were beautiful whisps of smoke all around the mountains.",
  "We got to the parking lot of where we were going to hike, and decided to first sit by the ocean and smoke some weed. Smoking weed on mushrooms makes me start tripping all over again, so by the time we finished, I was hallucinating really hard. We climbed into a really long culvert and were fascinated by the circle of daylight we could see outside, it was amazing. After that, our trip-sitter said he was going to take us to see the oracle. I immediately thought of the woman in the matrix, but realized it wouldn't be the same thing. So we started to hike up over the highway through the lush forest. We got to a clear spot in the trees and I could stand on the edge of the rock and see the ocean and the moutains and the forest, it was really amazing. I remeber standing there with my arms wide feeling like I was god with all the energy flowing through me.",
  "Our trip-sitter told us that if we wanted to see the oracle, we first had to go through a cave and be reborn. I am normally very claustrophobic, but I wasn't afraid at this point. So we climbed down into this cave and slithered through it. There was a very narrow section when we had to let all the air out of our lungs to get through, but I still wasn't afraid. Finally, we had to rock-climb out the other side and we were reborn. it was a very intense experience to have while on mushrooms. Finally, he told us we were ready to see the oracle.",
  "I wasn't sure what to expect, but as we came around a corner, he told us to be quiet, the oracle was up ahead. We came through the trees and there was a massive, old, overturned tree. It had beetle-eaten patterns all over it and what looked like a giant face. One of its eyes had exploded in a lump of wood and bark, but the other was still intact. Our trip-sitter told us it was the 'eye of sight, and the eye that has seen.' We stayed with the oracle for about an hour, touching the bark and looking at all the patterns and grooves. After hiking for about 7 hours, we headed back to my apartment and drank beers until we all fell asleep-which is, by the way, the absolute best way to end a trip."
