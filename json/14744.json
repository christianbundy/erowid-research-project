  "11:45PM",
  "-------",
  "    I weigh out 50mg of Ketamine HCl which was obtained pure (not as",
  "an injectible solution) from a chemical supplier. It is a crystalline",
  "powder with some rather large chunks that look like crystals of table",
  "salt. I crush this to a fine powder, then further powder it with a razor",
  "blade, and divide it into two even lines. This is about my 8th experience",
  "with ketamine, though I've never written a report about it before. Looking",
  "at this 50mg, it appears to be alot more than what I've done before.",
  "Erowid's ketamine dosage page states 'One method for nasal use is to",
  "insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until",
  "you reach your desired dosage.' I do not anticipate that there will be any",
  "need to repeat. Looking at this, I visually estimate that most of my prior",
  "experiences have been with around 30-40mg.",
  "12:00AM",
  "-------",
  "    I insufflate the first 25mg. There is a mild burn, but not too",
  "bad. The file mentions doing 50mg at once. I've decided to space it",
  "out somewhat and see how things work out.",
  "12:03AM",
  "-------",
  "    I feel very noticable effects. My body begins to feel strange. My",
  "head has a sort of 'balloon-like' feel to it, its somewhat like nitrous",
  "oxide without the sound in the head. Speaking of sounds... I put on",
  "Orbital's live mix of 'Halcyon On & On'. Normally this song is very",
  "pretty... but now, even with headphones, it sounds muffled or distant.",
  "Ketamine certainly doesn't seem to enhance music - quite the opposite.",
  "12:11AM",
  "-------",
  "    I am getting strange visual disturbances. Hard to explain really.",
  "I have the impression that things are moving, but nothing looks as though",
  "its moving. Corner-of-the-eye type stuff... but much more so. There is",
  "a flittiness to the visual effects that is vaguely reminiscent (I was",
  "completely unable to spell this word myself and had to ask for help on the",
  "Internet) of the visual effects produced by ecstasy. My visual field is",
  "swimming... thats the best word for it, somehow. As if looking at",
  "everything through some kind of moving liquid.",
  "12:18AM",
  "-------",
  "    There is a noticable drop in intensity of the effects. Visual",
  "effects are still present. I still have a feeling of 'dumbness' (not being",
  "able to remember words, etc). In fact I am nowhere near baseline. But the",
  "initial rush is over. My body feels 'weird.' There are no closed eye",
  "visuals.",
  "12:30AM",
  "-------",
  "    I still feel a little unusual, and my visual field is still",
  "swimming a little, but the effects are more or less over. 25mg remains",
  "sitting on my plate. I'm not sure I want to do it... I feel as if I wasted",
  "the first 25mg by sitting in front of a computer and trying to describe it",
  "in realtime - as if the very act of attempting to describe the effects",
  "prevents the more interesting effects form appearing.",
  "12:40AM",
  "-------",
  "    I divided the remaining 25mg into 2 more lines, and put some Orb",
  "on through headphones. I insufflate one of the 2 lines, then go to lay",
  "down and close my eyes and listen to music.",
  "12:45AM",
  "-------",
  "    No significant increase in effects from that  mg, so I insufflate",
  "the other. I go back to laying down, after skipping to a different Orb",
  "tune (Little Fluffy Clouds, Dance Mix MK2).",
  "12:56AM",
  "-------",
  "    The song ends. I get up to start writing. My body feels somewhat",
  "'detatched' - I can't quite explain it. Its not numbness per se, but",
  "shares some qualities. Laying on my bed was very odd. The bed felt hard,",
  "and the pillows felt hard, as if laying my head back on a cloth-covered",
  "rock. The overhead light in my bedroom appears somewhat like the light",
  "over an operating table. Not much in the way of closed eye visuals. Open",
  "eyed, my room looks somewhat stark and my perspective seems odd. Is my",
  "heart beating OK, am I breathing normal? I think. Don't really care. I",
  "find myself thinking of mundane, every day issues, trying to find answers",
  "to things which have been on my mind - no answers come to me that haven't",
  "already come to me sober. I seem to be able to think about things in a",
  "detatched, analytical way, but there is no enlightenment coming that I can",
  "see. Most drug 'spirits' I've dealt with have seemed to be male or female",
  "- not so ketamine. The ketamine 'spirit' seems robotic or mechanical in",
  "nature. This molecule taps into some very different energies than the",
  "traditional psychedelics. I would not consider this a psychedelic at all.",
  "Its something else entirely.",
  "1:08AM",
  "------",
  "    I feel I'm in approximately the same place as I was at the 12:18AM",
  "entry above. Visual field is swimming. Feel physically weird...a slight",
  "sensation of motion, perhaps. Somewhat dulled sensation. Music sounds",
  "mostly normal. But the mental effects have noticably dropped off. I feel",
  "more 'coherent' and though quite a ways above baseline, I'm definately",
  "aware that I'm headed there.",
  "1:20AM",
  "------",
  "    Visual effects are still quite noticable, though dramatically",
  "less than what they were. Other effects are decreasing rapidly. I decide",
  "to smoke some cannabis and conclude this experiment.",
  "1:34AM",
  "------",
  "    I am on IRC... I just had a very intense deja vu experience. I",
  "recieved 2 variations on the same chain email from 2 friends who are",
  "totall unconnected (except through me). Then all of the sudden I realized",
  "that the conversation I was having on IRC was something I had before. I",
  "had the strange feeling that I existed in that time segment twice. Just",
  "thought it was worth mentioning... Strange!"
