 "report": [
  "<p>I had an amazing journey last night. I went beyond the Stars and found myself in a completely different world. I was fully concious. I was able to walk around quite easily.",
  "My journey began at 11pm Sunday 23rd of November 2008. Before my journey I ate only my normal veggie food. No yeast or aged cheese was consumed. Ratatouie, Potatoes & a quorn kiev was eaten 5 hours before this experience.",
  "I ingested 3g of Syrian Rue Powder in 6 veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 20 minutes. I then consumed 3g of Psilocybe Semilanceata powdered in 6 veggie caps. Consuming 2 capsules every 20 minutes. The first two of these I consumed with the last two Syrian Rue Capsules. I then consumed 7.2g of Acacia Catechu bark powdered in to 12 veggie capsules. Each capsule contained 0.6g. The first two Acacia Catechu capsules were taken with the last two Psilocybe Semilanceata capsules. The rest were consumed 2 capsules every 30 minutes. All capsules were taken orally with a small amount of pure water.",
  "At 2am a snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) & 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) was consumed sublingually. At 3am a snuff mix consisting of 50% Yopo (Anadenanthera Peregrina) & 50% Cebil (Anadenanthera Colubrina) was consumed sublingually. The Yopo / Cebil was consumed subligually using natural saliva only and was ingested only after at least ten minutes in the mouth. Upon completion of this at 3.15 am I consumed 3 organic unsalted Scottish Oatcakes. Washed down with half a pint of water. I also consumed 1 teaspoon of Organic Clover Honey every hour from 2 am until 6am.",
  "There was no nausea. There was no purging, no diarrhea. This was a perfect journey.",
  "I was transfered from my bedroom to literally another planet. Waves of soft undulating Psilocybic ethereal ectoplasmic energy enveloped my room flowing freely from the ceiling and walls. There was a mauve / purple wall or enclosure around my bed. The ectoplasmic energy washed over me touching me very gently and very beautifully on my arms, legs and face. I was very warm and comfortable. My bedroom walls were lit only by my bedside lamp. Yet the white walls were in fact Green and Yellow latice fabric dense yet translucent. My bedroom wall showed me many illusions. I did not believe them and observed them with a silent clear mind. They were not real. This experience occurred with my eyes wide open. I was to learn that the images seen with closed eyes are not real. They are the illusion created by our own minds in order to mislead us in to introspection. But also some times the real world we live in is also not real and yet it is real. By this I mean what we see is unreal illusion. Yet beneath the illusion is true reality. With eyes wide open the true reality of my experience became profound. I was fully conscious and able to function as normal. Except this was not normal!",
  "I learnt from the universal mind.",
  "I was instructed that we can and do live in a multiverse. This is layered according to the vibrational frequency that our minds and being is attuned to. So there are people that are real there are people that are not. There are spirits that are real, there are",
  "spirits that are not. Each layer or level of this multiverse is inhabited by beings that are real and by beings that are not. In other words illusions. On our journeys we are supposed to discern which are real and which are not. Thus the destination of our journeys are determined by the ability of the seeker to understand and discern with purity what is real and what is not.",
  "Alien Vistas.",
  "As the full effects of dmt, yopo, cebil & liberty caps flowed from me through me & from without me I had the urge to look out of several windows, There were no cars no buses no vehicles no birds no animals no people only a very alien habitation / town. This town looked like the exact same town that I have lived in for twenty three years. Except that all of the buildings were made of a golden metalic compound. There were lights switched on in the windows of about a third of the houses. These felt like they were observing me. All the stars had changed. There were very few. There was no Moon. I did not recognised any. There were some U.F.O.s stationary yet when I moved to the next room window it would or they would be there. I know now that I am at a level just below that of full interaction. My lesson from this experience was clearly a starting point for destination much higher. There are many loving intelligences in existence at various levels of reality. They are often obscured in many by the illusion of fear baesed grotesque vile hiddeous spectres. But these are not real they are like a veil or curtain masking from the unworthy the beauty behind. It was remarkable how like glass or ice these spectres fall away or shatter like dust as I ignored them with a clear mind without fear.",
  "The true majesty and undescribable magnificent vistas can not be describe by words. It has to be experienced. I have leaned that we can all travel through the illusion of space time via entheogenic transportation.",
  "This is the true teleportation system.",
  "By the way the beings or being told me without words, that the purges are only for those that need to be cleansed of the accumilation of negative energy, thoughts fears and illusions. I am assured that once these are removed there is no need of purging a clear mind.</p>"
