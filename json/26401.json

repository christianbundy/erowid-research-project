 "report": "<p>When I saw Liz at school she looked happy as most people (not me though, ever!) I said you are not feeling any stress right now are you. She said nope. I said I could tell by her eyes. Her pupils were the perfect size not too big like stimulants, stress or psychedelics do or too small like heroin or depression will do.</p><p>She said she'd be taking zanies and offer me one in class. How nice I thought. When this new girl Liz gave me a zanie, only one. I felt really intoxicated and giddy and frankly incoherent like when Im drunk as hell; I even said to her at one point to Liz that I loved her. These feelings gave way to sleepiness and then me feeling nice n' calm.</p><p>At lunch I was sedated and I felt satisfied(emotionally). I was pretty stone-faced. I had significant CNS depression. I moved and spoke slow. I didn't really want to speak nor did I think about speaking or much of anything for that matter, which is very unusual; I am quite hyper but small talk isnt that great anyway. Everything I ate was just great. The flavor of sweets was very pronounced like when Im stoned but better. After lunch cloudy headness manifested itself as blurred vision. I don't remember anything else I probably went to sleep later. I liked it though.</p>",
