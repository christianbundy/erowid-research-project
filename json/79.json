 "report": [
  "On a warm spring evening earlier this year, a group of good friends and I decided to do some mush. We ate them whole and as soon as everyone started to feel it we took off on a long walk.",
  "We walked to a beautiful spot overlooking the river and downtown and just sat and talked. My friend M surprised us all by bringing out some whippets and his cracker. As soon as I got my balloon I laid back and looked up at the star filled sky.",
  "I had taken about 2-3 huffs on my balloon when the sky changed from night to day. It was the most beautiful blue sky I have ever seen with big fluffy, billowy clouds. As I sat there a dove flew directly in front of me and I was aware of a bright light (I know it sounds like a near death experience) but it was not in my field of vision. There was a strong but kind male voice saying 'Come with me' or 'Be with me' over and over again. The entire experience couldn't have lasted much more then a minute but it seemed to go on forever. It was very peaceful and soothing and nothing like any other mushroom/whippet experience I have ever had.",
  "When I started to come back to earth, the first words out of my mouth were ' Aw, shit you guys I had a religious one.' I was quite disappointed really. I have never been much for religion and although I always believed in God I truly never thought of Him much.",
  "Of course my friends were asking me to tell them about it but I found I had no words to describe what had just happened. As I laid there I understood that something unusual and very special had happened. It was both a wonderful and frightening feeling.",
  "We did a few more whippets and although I tried to recapture the first vision all I got were funky visuals. I feel lucky to have had this experience and although I am still searching for the meaning behind it, I know in my heart there is someone out there watching over us."
