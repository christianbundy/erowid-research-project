 "report": "<p>Purpose</p><p>My previous experiences with 2C-I, at doses ranging from 3mg to 21mg, had left me with the impression that the chemical had very little to offer besides some very nice visuals and a capacity for some introspection. It always seemed that during a 2C-I trip, I could simply let my mind go idle and enjoy the show.</p><p>What I've found with tryptamines such as psiloc(yb)in and LSD is that they make my mind work a whole lot harder, and I felt like these drugs had much more depth to the experience than any phenethylamine could offer, including mescaline (which I've only tried once).</p><p>This trip report is about the time that I directly challenged 2C-I to impress me. I was seeking confusion, revelation, a difficult trip... anything besides idle-minded eye candy.</p><p>Preparation</p><p>My friend T (who I ate LSD with a few weeks ago) wanted to eat some 2C-I... so I took an 18mg dose and a 12mg dose and evened out the difference by eye... giving us both doses of approximately 15mg. I know from experience that a dose between 14-17mg is adequate to get 'full effects' from 2C-I, while keeping the adverse physical symptoms to a minimum.</p><p>At about 9:15pm we swallowed our gel caps and went to finish watching the Red Sox vs. Yankees playoff game.</p><p>I kept with me a water bottle, and took a nice gulp every 20-30 minutes. I've found this is the best way to keep stomach pain away and other digestive side effects to a minimum. Of course this means I have to piss frequently (especially since 2C-I seems to dehydrate me), but it's the only way.</p><p>The Trip</p><p>Just before eating the gel cap I had smoked a couple of bowls with two friends, so while I was watching the game I noticed my weed high diminish and slowly get replaced by a more psychedelic 'warmth'. By 10:00pm I was already noticing the lamp post next to me wiggling a little bit, and the carpet was shifting just a little.</p><p>The game ended around 11:00pm, and the Sox won so I was happy. 'T' is a Yankees fan so that didn't really put him in a good mood. By this time the carpet was patterning and shifting in the geometric/Aztec-looking ways that I am used to seeing on phenethylamines.</p><p>Some time, not long after the game, I figured I had peaked/plateaued and I went to use the toilet. The tile floor beneath my feet was in constant motion, swirling around and rising up. The best part was whereever I stepped, Aztec-looking patterns would grow out of my feet. Likewise the walls were constantly changing hue/color and there were patterns suspended in the air and I could easily make stop-motion tracers by waving my hand about. Nice eye candy, I thought, but my thought process was only altered 1/5th as much as it would be on an equally visual dose of any tryptamine. It was at this point, standing in the bathroom, that I taunted the drug: 'Show me your power! Mess with my mind! Challenge me!'</p><p>I then went back out to watch Wayne's World with 'T', who was just beginning to feel the effects of the 2C-I at this point, and appeared to be coming up fast. We watched about half of Wayne's World, all the while analysing the subtle layers of hilarity in the movie. At a point we both became too distracted by the walls, tapestries, carpet, etc. and we decided that watching a movie would be a waste.</p><p>We went upstairs and I picked up my guitar and played some really trippy music. Sometimes when I'm tripping I can play way beyond my normal ability, sometimes I can't play at all. Well, I played really well, jamming on the clean channel nonstop for about 20 minutes, and that made me happy. 'T' looked at an online art gallery meanwhile. I realized that I had not actually peaked an hour earlier, and I was more likely peaking now.</p><p>Around midnight we smoked a couple bowls of beasters and put some tunes on the computer. That kicked us both up a notch. I looked at the art gallery and saw patterns resembling the artwork flowing out of my monitor. The images were in constant motion and I thought it looked really cool, although it lacked the depth and meaning that was in the art last time I looked at it on LSD. I focused on my trip and tried to strengthen it, remembering how before I had earlier asked 2C-I to really impress me.</p><p>Then all of a sudden my trip took a turn for the weird. I could barely talk, and whatever I did say didn't make any sense. So I just sat there for a while, but my body started to feel kind of weird. Static-like, I guess. I started to think deeply, and nearly got caught in a paranoid negative thought loop that I was being poisoned by the drug I had taken. My heart was beating fast, but not so fast that it couldn't be attributed to the pot I had just smoked. I narrowly escaped panic. Admittedly, I was surprised that 2C-I was able to almost send me into a bad trip. I felt like 2C-I had lived up to the challenge that I had posed to it. But it wasn't over.</p><p>Right after that I started to feel physically weak, so I chugged some water and tried to focus. My visuals kicked up a notch all of a sudden, like the colors of everything were constantly changing and the patterns were becoming pronounced. The morphing seemed to pick up in speed as did the changing colors, and I felt like my environment was suddenly becoming very chaotic. I might have enjoyed this, except remember my body was starting to feel weak...</p><p>I was listening to 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' by Harrison and right away the pitch, volume, and tempo of the sound starting going completely out of whack. It sounded like someone was fucking around with the pitch, tempo, and volume knobs. This sounded REALLY weird and it made the music sound spooky. I tried to make it stop by focusing really hard, but there was nothing I could do. In addition to this, my vision seemed to be coming apart like static all around me. Whenever the pitch of the music would swoop low, my vision would also 'slow down'. I felt like I was becoming detached from my senses. On a dissociative, or a tryptamine I might have enjoyed this, but on 2C-I I felt like these were symptoms relating to my physical well-being rather than my mind.</p><p>I asked 'T' a few times to turn off the music, and he finally heard me and obliged. I took a few minutes to chill out, and fortunately things did calm down a notch for me. After chilling out I told 'T' I needed a change of scenery. By now it was around 2:00am, and I went downstairs and crawled into bed with my girlfriend. I felt a lot better once I was around her, told her what had happened, etc. Bonus points for her for so well accomodating the tripping boyfriend =)</p><p>At this point I started to come down... around 3:00am I fell asleep, no problem. 2C-I's stimulation always leaves me with the option to feel sedated and sleepy or energetic.</p><p>It Passed the Test</p><p>2C-I kicked my ass in a way that I hadn't expected. Full audio hallucinations, paranoid thought loops, inability to effectively communicate with others...</p><p>Proof that mindset plays a major role in the outcome of a trip.</p><p>Also proof that heroic doses of 2C-I are completely unnecessary. In fact I tripped harder from this 15mg dose than my largest dose of 21mg.</p><p>This trip renewed my interest in phenethylamines, but I no longer look at them as a more 'recreational' alternative to tryptamines.</p><p>peace</p>",
