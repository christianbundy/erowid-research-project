 "report": "<p>Recently I have been hearing quite a bit about tripping off of Dramamine. I have several friends who have done it on a few occasions and have read about it on the internet. I found out several things about this drug. It sounded like it might be a fun experience, but I also found out that it was easy for the trip to become excruciatingly unpleasant. I decided that the only way for me to find out if I would like it or not, would be to try it for myself.</p><p>It was a Tuesday night and I had the next few days off of school for vacation so I decided then would be a good time to try it. I planned on taking the pills after my parents went to bed and just staying at my house the night to experience the trip. I went down to the local grocery store and pocketed a tube of regular Dramamine (I wanted Dramamine ll, because that doesn't cause as much drowsiness, but they came in packs of 8 and I was pretty nervous about stealing them. They don't let minors purchase over the counter drugs where I live.) I went home and ingested all 12 pills, along with some water at 10:30. After that I went downstairs and chatted with some friends on the internet and played my guitar. I heard the effects were supposed to take an hour to set in but within 15-20 minutes I felt it. I was having a little trouble concentrating and stopped playing my guitar. At 11:00 I was definitely feeling it so I got off the computer and went and laid down on the couch. I was watching some TV when I noticed it seemed to have a 3D effect to it. The reception began to get fuzzy and there were lines waving across the TV screen, but it looked as if they were waving across all of my vision. I began to get tired. I felt as if I had just gotten a shot of sedation that they give you before surgery. I kept dozing off and time was going extremely slow. I was not having any major hallucinations yet though.</p><p>I was quite uncomfortable and was tossing and turning on the couch. I rolled over at one point and saw a giant black bug flying right at me. It vanished into thin air, but it scared the living shit out of me. After that I became excited. I wanted more hallucinations to start. I waited but no more came. I could barely stay awake so I decided to get up and do something. I was dizzy and could barely walk. I stumbled around and had to grab hold of things to keep my balance. I kept forgetting what I was doing so I went up to my room and turned on my black light. I laid there staring at things but everything seemed normal. I was having NO hallucinations whatsoever. After a while I dozed off, I'm not actually sure if I fell asleep its all pretty much a blur after this. I do remember at one point i saw this sort of 'invisible' creature rise up out of my bed with swirling blue lines around it, and at another point I though I saw a ruler laying on my bed but it turned out to be a wrinkle in the sheets.</p><p>I woke up a little before 1:00 and it felt like the effects had completely worn off. I was pretty upset and disappointed at the effects of the drug. I had heard about hallucinations much stronger and much more than what I had experienced. I went back to bed a little bit later and woke up at 9:00 the next morning feeling normal.</p>",
