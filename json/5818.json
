 "report": "<p>This one is a real kicker, and I'm not sure where to start, so I'll start from the beginning.</p><p>Every year, Cleveland, Ohio holds a St. Patricks day parade through the streets.  Two friends of mine  take this opportunity to drive to Cleveland (2 hours) and drop acid.  The reason for this is that everyone in Cleveland is drunk in the streets on St. Patricks Day, and we can act goofy and messed up and it's not that unusual.  This year, I decided to join them.</p><p>I'm not a heavy drug user, but I tend to experiment with a great variety of substances.  I've done weed on many occasions, nitrous on even more occasions, PCP once by accident, Salvia four or five times with wonderful effects, abused prescription pills by eating, snorting, or smoking them, drank a couple times (dont like it), huffed ether and glade once each, and taken morning glory seeds once (EXTREME POISON). </p><p>A couple days before the trip, we all went to a friends house to aquire the lsd.  This went off without a hitch, and we each bought one geltab.  The day of the trip, I woke up at 8:45, and had a light breakfast of coffee and doughnuts.  I was anticipating a wild and fun day, so I was in a really good mood.  I then got in my car and picked up my friends.</p><p>I decided to take dose as soon as we left.  This was about 10:15.  Being my first time, I decided to take only half the acid at first.  I let it dissolve under my tongue, and then went on with the car ride as usual.</p><p>After 45 minutes had passed, I noticed a slight effect.  Sort of like when I've been awake a long long time and my thinking all funny, but without the sleepiness and other bad effects.  After an hour, we were half way there, and I was definatly tripping.  It was nothing like I had imagined.  I thought of tripping as like being on weed, but with hallucinations.  This is wrong.  When I smoke a lot of weed, I get paranoid and scared.  Not with acid.  The feeling is so incredibly strange, It's really a bizzar high.  At this point, I decided to take the other half of the dose.  We stopped at the McDonalds drive through, and all got O.J.  But it wasnt just oj, it was O  J !!!  I felt so good, I couldnt wipe the smile off my face.  Acid is not scary (but I see how it could be in the wrong situation) its a beautiful, strange feeling.</p><p>After arriving at cleveland, we decided to go to the flats.  This is an area with lots of bars and night clubs and craziness.  By this time, I was peaking.  Everything looked so strange, and all my sences were distorted.  We stopped half way there, in the lobby of some law offices to warm up.  The brick wall was made so that the borders of the bricks were uneven, some were square, some pentagons, ect.  I stared at the spot where the bricks met the carpet, and lo and behold, the bricks were moving, and sinking down, pulling the carpet along with them. </p><p>When we got to the flats, we pretty much wandered around the streets for several hours.  It was great.  Colors seemed brighter, patterns on walls moved.  The greatest thing about acid, was that the hallucinations were an extention of my mind.  If I concentrate on somthing moving, you can get it to look like its moving!  It's kind of like living in a dream world, where anything can happen.  Everything around me was strange and unfamiliar.  Acid is definatly nothing like I thought it would be.  It's very bizzar, and strange.</p><p>That night, I couldnt sleep until 2:00 AM.  I was still feeling funny at this time.  The next day, I still felt funny, but it was managable.  It's been about a week, and I have noticed that the acid has changed me.  My perception of the world is different.  Colors look better, music is more intreuging, and I generally am in a better moodI'm so happy I did it, it's really an experience to think about.  The only word of caution I have is make sure you have ALL DAY AND NIGHT to do nothing but trip and recover.  Personally, I wouldnt want to deal with authority figures even for a good 8 hours after it wears off, it lingered for a LONG time.  Well, thats my experience, so be careful, and have fun!!</p>",
