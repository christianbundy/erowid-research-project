 "report": "<p>In late 2003, I was diagnosed with adult ADD. My psychiatrist recommended putting me on strattera 40 Mg. I had not done too well with the other stimulant medications, which is why he decided to try strattera. I was apprehensive at first about taking strattera. At the time, I was also taking Zoloft for anxiety. A large part of my anxiety included taking pills. After a few days of studying the side effects of dangers of strattera, I came to the conclusion that it was safe and may be very beneficial to me. </p><p>At the time, I worked second shift at a gas station. So I always had plenty of sleep because I went to bed around midnight and woke up around 10:00 or 11:00. On the day of my first dose, I took the strattera about 2 hours before work. Upon my arrival at work, I noticed I was extremely tired. I was having a lot of difficulty keeping my eyes open and communicating. I decided to go into the back room and lay down for a minute just to breath and try to bring myself to. The floor was cold and hard, but I literally fell asleep instantly upon lying down. I mean like instantly into a deep sleep. Shortly after falling asleep, I heard my name called over the intercom. This jolted me awake as my subconscious knew I was at work and did not want to get caught sleeping on the job. </p><p>A little while later, as I was still struggling to stay awake, I noticed I had to pee. I went into the bathroom and began relieving myself. Now, If youre a man, you know that when you're done, you have to shake or squeeze those last few drops of piss out. If youre a woman, well, you know now. Anyway, when it came to this point, I noticed a strange feeling in my penis, as thought there was something clogging it up. I proceeded to squeeze it out and with it came a large amount of semen. I proceeded to continue squeezing what remained inside of me into the basin of the urinal. All in all it was well over the typical amount ejaculated during orgasm. I certainly was not orgasming; in fact it was somewhat painful. By the time I was done, My organ was extremely sore and ached. Much the way it feels after a night of intercourse. The rest of the day was spent struggling to stay awake, and at times things almost seemed surreal, as if I was dreaming, although, this was rare and not too prevalent. </p><p>Within a few days, the tiredness side effect had left me and I was able to function normally, although, I was sill perhaps a little more tired than what was normal for me. However, the other problem with the leaky semen continued for quite some time. After a month of taking strattera, I had noticed little to no improvement in my ADD symptoms and reported this and my side effects to my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist was baffled by the effect the strattera was having on my sex organ and reported that he had never heard of this effect from strattera or from anything for that matter but found it interesting because only a few days earlier, had the same report from a patient who was also taking Zoloft.</p><p>My psychiatrist decided that if I wasn't noticing any improvements after one month, than strattera was not right for me. All in all, I would have to say that my experience with strattera was unpleasant with no improvement in my ADD symptoms, and the semen side effect was really quite unpleasant. The pain from this side effect usually made it difficult for me to make love with my partner, as I was too sore to do anything. </p><p>However, if your doctor or psychiatrist recommends strattera for you, I would recommend giving it a try. Everyone responds differently to medications, and certainly some people have benefited greatly from strattera.  I now work at a treatment center and I have met a few people who take strattera. None of them had the same problem I had with the leaky semen, although, many of them do report that during the first few days of taking strattera, they are either very tired, or feel somewhat wired. All of these people report that those side effects go away after a few days and all of these people have benefited greatly from strattera.</p>"
